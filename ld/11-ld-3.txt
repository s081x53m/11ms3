i. How are people stronger than social media?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
People are stronger than social media as they can easily think before they act and think before they speak.<br>
 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. Does social media have positive impact in the society? Discuss.<br>
In today's society, social media has a positive impact. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it possible for us to stay in touch with family, friends, and relatives who live in different parts of the world. People can use these social networking sites to share photos and videos, as well as communicate with their friends and family. This strengthens our bonds and brings families closer together in ways that were previously impossible.<br>
Professional websites and official organisation web pages provide numerous opportunities to learn new facts, explore the world, and read the most recent survey results, reports, and other information. There has been a significant increase in online learning, and a strong profession has grown up around it. It's worth noting that people who work in businesses can also benefit from social media. Online promotions are less expensive than running ads on TV and in newspapers on a regular basis. They do, however, provide an opportunity to reach a larger audience and find active customers all over the world. Businesspeople can understand the state of the market and adopt new strategies to meet the tastes and demands of customers by interacting with them and receiving feedback from them. E-commerce and digital marketing are popular nowadays.<br>
Users can use social media to share their thoughts and opinions, create their own content, and keep up with the latest news and information. Finding a job and hiring the right people are also important.<br>
 <br>
b. How do you compare virtual communication and face-to-face communication?<br>
There is a sender, a message, and a recipient in communication. When the receiver understands the sender's message, the process is complete. People use both virtual and face-to-face methods to make conversations more comfortable and convenient.<br>
 <br>
Virtual communication does not necessitate the presence of the recipient. It allows us to communicate with people regardless of their location. Nonverbal communication is more likely. We can keep in touch with people via virtual communication even if they are busy and unable to meet in person. Virtual communication is commonly conducted through a variety of social networking sites and apps. When we communicate virtually, it's easier to organise and share all of the information we need.<br>
Face-to-face communication necessitates the presence of both the sender and the recipient, as well as a prompt response. We can actively notice someone's level of attention in our conversation when we talk to them face to face. It allows us to socialise and form personal relationships. It keeps our communication skills from rusting. We can express what we want to say very precisely with our body language and tone. Because both verbal and nonverbal communication methods are used in face-to-face communication, the message can be easily understood by the parties involved. It is preferable for illiterate people because they cannot comprehend written messages. Conversations on the phone or on a cell phone, as well as chatting on the internet, are examples of oral communication, but they are not the same as face-to-face communication.<br>
 <br>

Cyberbullying<br>
One of the most serious issues facing today's youth is cyberbullying. Devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets have made this type of crime easier. Cyber bullying is a common occurrence in which children, teenagers, and even adults are targeted, humiliated, tortured, or threatened online.<br>
 <br>
Rumors, threats, posting sexual comments, sharing the victim's personal information, and hate speech are all examples of harmful bullying behavior. Bullying is commonly found on social networking sites, SMS, email, and online gaming.<br>
Cyberbullying can lead to a slew of issues for victims. Victims of cyberbullying feel unsafe even when they are at home. It is extremely difficult to avoid. It causes mental, emotional, and physical harm to the person because its effects can last for a long time. Low self-esteem, even suicidal tendencies, and a variety of negative emotional reactions may be experienced by the victim.<br>
 <br>
If we believe we are being bullied, the first thing we should do is seek assistance from our parents, a close family member, or a trusted adult. We should call the cops if we are in danger. Cyberbullying legislation is still relatively new, and it does not exist in every state. Many countries rely on other relevant laws to punish cyberbullies for this reason. Bullying must be identified and reported in order to be prevented. We must be cautious about what we share or say that may cause harm to others.<br>
