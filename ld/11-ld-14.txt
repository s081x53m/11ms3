Critical thinking<br>
a. What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in power for long in a country? Discuss.<br>
There are many successful political leaders in the world, but only a handful live up to the leadership principles. Many political leaders, in reality, lack the most critical leadership characteristics. History &ndash; and current events &ndash; demonstrate that there are still a few who adhere to leadership principles and serve as excellent models of effective political leaders.<br>
Characteristics of a good political leader include accountability, Honesty, Compassion, Integrity, Flexibility, Confidence etc.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal? Explain.<br>
In terms of democratic practise, Nepal is still immature. The concept of communal decision-making, which allows all individuals to participate equally, is guaranteed by the constitution, but it is not implemented in practise. <br>
 <br>
In the current environment, the democratic system envisioned by Abraham Lincoln does not apply in Nepal, where corruption, paralysed constitutional and governmental institutions, illiteracy, and poverty are significant concerns. The effective functioning of constitutional organs and governmental institutions is critical to democratic norms and ideals. A certain set of individuals has crippled them. The function of bureaucracy is critical in keeping the administration running efficiently so that development plans may be implemented quickly. The corrupt bureaucrats, on the other hand, do not perform their duties without bribes, and they are backed by political leaders. <br>
 <br>
The Nepalese people have never known a government that is responsible and accountable. Nepotism and favouritism have been rampant in government organisations. In our nation, illiteracy and poverty have always been issues. According to recent statistics, Nepal's literacy rate is increasing. However, a significant portion of the population is illiterate. They are more inclined to join the bandwagon and follow the throng. Because of this inability, people are readily swayed by political leaders. In the end, leaders are able to wield power and abuse it. People's hunger, on the other hand, provides a chance for opportunist parties to take advantage of impoverished people's political independence. <br>
 <br>
In return for a vote, they provide monetary assistance or promise to improve the quality of life. Following that, the election is in the hands of such leaders. Even wealthy nations have difficulties in putting democratic ideals into practise. Institutionalizing democracy has been more challenging in nations such as Nepal. All constitutional entities, government institutions, and people should be held accountable in order to promote democratic ideals.<br>
