 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.<br>
 <br>
In an autocracy, power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual. Fear and control are features of the authoritarian political system. Absolute monarchs and military dictators have historically served as instances of autocracy. When rapid and definite action is required, autocracy has a significant benefit in that important choices can be taken swiftly. Autocratic leaders often make decisions based on their own ideas and judgements, and they seldom take input from their followers.<br>
 <br>
The rulers have the ability to collect resources for whatever seems to be essential and then command their subjects to carry out the vision. Autocrats had some of the most powerful militaries in history. They're helpful for keeping an eye on both their own people and invading neighbours. Autocrats don't have to worry about anybody since they set their own rules and have unchallenged power. The Great Wall, the Taj Mahal, and other great wonders of civilisation have all been the brainchild of autocrats. The kings built such marvels in the sake of immortality, celebrating a war win, devotion to their loved ones, garnering popularity, and employing unskilled and semi-skilled workers as well as brilliant craftsmen.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?<br>
Feudalism is a social system that prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages in which people (vassals) were given land and protection by a nobleman (lord), and had to work and fight for him in return.<br>
 <br>
The lowest class members of society were provided with social and economic protection during the feudal system. The landlords couldn't take away the vassals' land, so they had to look after them while they were disabled. The method aided in the development of character traits such as loyalty, courage, charity, humility, and politeness. Lords and vassals formed alliances based on a strong regard for honesty and keeping promises. The vassals treated the lords with the utmost respect and served them with devotion and humility. In exchange, the lords showed their love and generosity to the vassals. Social and moral trends were formed by feudal rulers. They demonstrated to the rest of the world how to dress, dine, and approach a woman for a dance, among other things.<br>
 <br>
Feudal laws had the ability to bind the monarch. This was very useful to the middle classes in checking royal tyranny in the later era. The feudal system paved the groundwork for contemporary state formation. With the passage of time, certain feudal lords were able to gain an advantage over their competitors and expand their domains. As a result, powerful kingdoms arose.<br>
Feudalism, it is said, created social class divides. The population were split into two classes: nobles and vassals. It also produced a wealth gap between the wealthy and the poor. The poor had to make do with what they had, while the nobility and the wealthy lived a life of luxury and idleness.<br>
 <br>
The vassals' living circumstances were terrible during the feudal system. The vassals may retain territories that the nobility had granted them. They were expected to serve the nobility as slaves and labour for them. It became more difficult for countries to form under the feudal system. Nobles from one area continued to battle nobles from other regions, making it impossible to create peaceful countries under such unstable conditions. The frequent feuds amongst nobility produced an environment of unrest. <br>
 <br>
Furthermore, the presence of such volatile circumstances made it impossible for society to evolve. Due to competition, mistrust, and conflict, Europe was unable to unify. The feudal system seemed to be a factor in Europe's failure to unify. There could be no really sovereign nations in Europe if there was no unity.<br>
