Critical thinking<br>
a. &ldquo;Down the rabbit hole&rdquo; is a sort of writing called fantasy. On the basis of your reading of the story point out some special elements of this kind of writing?<br>
Fantasy is a fiction genre which contains people and situations that would be impossible to find in real life. A magical penguin, for example, is unlikely to be encountered in real life. Some of the best fantasy books are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Lord of the Rings.<br>
The primary narrative, subject, and location of most fantasy stories are based on magic or other supernatural aspects. A fight between good and evil, the seasons, the cycle of life-birth, development, and death, a hero's quest, a heroine being rescued by a lovely guy, and confronting a make-believe monster are all part of the plot of a fantasy.<br>
 <br>
Characters in fantasy stories include witches, wizards, fairies, princes and princesses, kings and queens, knights, dragons, talking animals, angels and demons, elves, gnomes, unicorns, and so on. A fantasy takes place in a distant country, an enchanted kingdom, a magical woodland, in mediaeval times, in an imagined universe, in paradise, or in the hereafter. The subject of protecting honour, loyalty, discovering a mystery item, fulfilling a mission, sacrificing something, and so on is used by fantasy writers.<br>
 <br>
b. Is it good to imagine of things which are not possible to achieve in reality? Explain.<br>
Most people believe that imagination has nothing to do with reality. They don&rsquo;t not relate it with success, achievement and reality. They consider it as impractical. But imagination shapes the way which influences our hopes, actions and behaviors.<br>
 <br>
One of the most important elements to success is imagination. It's usually associated with daydreaming, wishing, and deception. The imagination is where a person's desire, aim, and plan begin, and it is only later that they become reality. Electric lights were a fantasy of Thomas Edison's, and he made them a reality. Walt Disney envisioned himself as the leader of the world's biggest animation empire and made it a reality despite tremendous criticism.<br>
 <br>
Various studies indicate that a successful individual visualises his objective in his mind and then takes the necessary measures to make it a reality. A clear mental picture of what he wants to accomplish aids him in seeing his objective and the path to it in detail. Furthermore, he cultivates characteristics such as willingness, passion, commitment, and dedication in himself in order to bring things to fruition. Things are never unattainable when someone imagines something they really want and takes the necessary steps to get it. Things always appear impossible until they are shown to be true.<br>
