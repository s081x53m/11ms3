 <br>
A Few Kind Words for Superstition<br>
Critical Thinking<br>
a. What is the key takeaway of this essay? Do you think that this essay is satirical? Why?<br>
The purpose of this article is to challenge the commonly held belief that superstition is solely held by the ignorant and irrational, and to provide a new viewpoint on superstition. Every person, no matter how logical or reasonable, has superstitions, which is a normal and natural characteristic, despite the fact that it is not stated explicitly. Except for the fact that the essay will be about superstition, the writer makes no specific or apparent statements about what the article will be about.<br>
 <br>
Many superstitions, according to the writer, are so pervasive and ancient that they must have sprung from a depth of human thought that is unconcerned with race or religion. For him, superstition is linked to a human need to know his destiny and have a part in determining it.<br>
 <br>
The essay is sarcastic in nature. It mocks intelligent and educated individuals who believe in superstition while having no connection to it. The writer utilises a variety of instances from his personal life at the University where he resides, his surroundings, and his religious studies to discuss superstition. These nonsensical events in the essay make a mockery of science and contemporary human civilization. <br>
 <br>
Some superstitious activities rational people believe in include throwing salt over one's left shoulder after spilling it, avoiding walking under a ladder, consulting the I Ching to resolve a matter concerning university affairs, placing jujus, lucky coins, and other bringers of luck on the desks of candidates in an examination hall, and so on.The writer mocks his own superstitious habits, admitting that he paid four shillings to touch a Lucky Baby before completing college examinations as a joke.<br>
 <br>
b. Can education bring change in the belief of superstition? Present your arguments to support your answer.<br>
Education has the potential to alter superstitious beliefs. It enhances thinking abilities and intellect. People who are educated are less prone to be superstitious, and they may educate others about the harmful behaviour. At the very least, educated people take ill people to the hospital rather than hiring witch doctors to cast out demons to heal them. Education helps people understand illnesses, their causes, and how to treat them.<br>
 <br>
When someone is afraid of the unknown, they develop superstitions. There is no longer any superstition when the unfamiliar becomes familiar. A person's dread of the mind will be eliminated if they learn the real truth behind different useless things.<br>
True, paranormal experiences are deeply embedded in people's brains. The reason for this is the influence of the society in which they grow up and the cultural activities in which they participate. It is difficult, but not impossible, to eliminate them. It can only be done by educated individuals.<br>
