 <br>
Answer:<br>
The main point of Mandela&rsquo;s speech is that people of South Africa should build a society where there will be justice, peace, rights, and equality for all people.<br>
 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. What does Mandela mean when he says - a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world?<br>
The phrase &quot;a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the globe,&quot; coined by Mandela, refers to the oneness of multi-culturalism and the coming-together of individuals from many different countries in a country that was previously divided into white and black under Apartheid rule.<br>
 <br>
A rainbow is a colour combination comprising seven different hues. In contrast to the previous separation based on skin colour, South Africa is referred to as a Rainbow Nation to describe the unification of different cultural, racial, or ethnic groupings in the nation during the post-apartheid era. The rainbow is a sign of optimism and a bright future in various South African traditions.<br>
Mandela envisioned a peaceful setting in which they could create a society in which all South Africans, black and white, could live without fear and with complete human dignity. He wished for them to live and work together like a rainbow's ring of colours. He hoped they could have forgotten the past's brutality and oppression.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. Mandela should have avenged those who imprisoned him for such a long period. Instead, he followed the path of reconciliation. Why do you think he did so?<br>
Mandela skillfully governed his nation, fostering healing and living up to the aspirations of his worldwide followers. He effectively navigated a nation in disarray toward a negotiated solution. He affirmed national reconciliation, a concept he didn't only promote in theory, but put into practise by reaching out to old foes. He never avenged those who imprisoned him, tormented his people, and perpetrated crimes against South Africa's non-white population.<br>
 <br>
Mandela has the ability to forgive others. He thought that feelings of hatred, vengeance, and rivalry separate individuals, causing chaos and instability. A societal divide, in his opinion, disrupts social peace. He regarded national reconciliation as the most important job of his presidency, as he presided over the country's transition from apartheid minority control to multicultural democracy.<br>
 <br>
Mandela reassured South Africa's white people that they were protected and represented in the country after visiting other postcolonial African countries that had been ruined by the departure of white elites. He persuaded his followers that success was impossible without togetherness. His goal was to free all of his people from the shackles of poverty, hardship, pain, gender, and other forms of prejudice.<br>
 <br>
c. Why and how have societies struggled with segregation in the world? Do you find any evidence of segregation in your society? Discuss.<br>
The social division of people based on a variety of criteria such as race, ethnicity, or country is called Segregation . It's used to denote an unequal situation. Many civilizations throughout the globe have battled with this issue. Racial segregation is one of the most frequent types of segregation, and although it is usually prohibited, it may nevertheless persist due to societal conventions even if no strong individual desire exists. Racial segregation has shown itself in multiracial societies all throughout the globe.<br>
 <br>
Segregation is a practise that may be either deliberate or self-imposed. Segregation in any form may cause social, economic, and political problems. Minorities flee mainstream culture because they are seen as lesser creatures. The concept of segregation denies disadvantaged people their civil and political rights. This long-standing practise often obstructs basic integration and equality. Such behaviour is often shown, for example, in the denial of equal chances that impact people's living circumstances. <br>
 <br>
Women, members of castes, homosexuals, and members of other religious groups have all seen persecution throughout history. Nepalese law forbids any segregation of society based on religion, caste, or ethnicity. It is recognised, however, because of its inherent existence in communities. Temple security closely monitors entry into the inner courtyard of Pashupati temple. Only Hindu and Buddhist descendants of Indian and Tibetan ancestors are allowed to enter the temple courtyard. Non-Nepali, Indian, and Tibetan Hindus and Buddhists, as well as other non-Hindu tourists, are prohibited from entering the temple complex.<br>
