Critical thinking<br>
a. Do you think that the title &ldquo;Foresters without Diplomas&rdquo; is suitable to the essay? How?<br>
 <br>
The essay's title, &quot;Foresters Without Diplomas,&quot; is appropriate. The whole article focuses on Kenyan women's attempts to make the Green Belt Movement a success.<br>
 <br>
The writer and her team initially summoned the foresters to demonstrate how they grow trees to the ladies. Because they possessed degrees, the foresters proved to be very difficult to work with. They developed complicated ways for coping with seemingly basic tasks like as searching for seeds and growing trees. Finally, the writer and her colleagues instructed the ladies on how to do the task using common sense, which they accomplished. They were able to search the area for seeds and learn to identify seedlings as they sprouted from seeds that had fallen to the ground. Women did not have the same opportunities as males.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. Can a person make a difference in a society? Discuss with an example from a person who has made a difference in your society.<br>
 <br>
It is not simple to accept the notion that &quot;I can make a difference in society&quot;. In reality, it is tough but not impossible. We can accomplish more if we all work together to improve society. Making society better entails mending laws, but also society's compassion, generosity, social labour, and obligations as well. A person who values others above own gain may influence others. Here is an example of a good person.<br>
 <br>
Neighbor, Dr. Ramesh Thapa He works for the state. He's one of the city's finest surgeons. Every three months he conducts a mobile clinic campaign in our area for the poor. He also oversees free medical care for 4 chronically ill people. He has saved many lives. His loved ones are always there for him.<br>
 <br>
Sober and humble. Humanity comes first. Several organisations have recognised his good deeds. We are very proud of him.<br>
