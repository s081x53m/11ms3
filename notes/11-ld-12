    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. “Down the rabbit hole” is a sort of writing called fantasy. On the basis of your reading of the story
        point out some special elements of this kind of writing?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The word fantasy refers to an illusion or an imaginative idea. The fantastic, a related word, also describes
    something that is imaginary and unrealistic. As its name suggests, the literary genre of fantasy refers to stories
    filled with imaginary and unrealistic elements.
    <br>
    <br>
    Events in a fantasy operate outside the laws of the real universe and typically involve supernatural elements, like
    magic or magical creatures. Unlike science fiction, which is generally set in the future, fantasy is commonly set in
    the past. Fantasy stories often contain elements of medieval life, such as castles, knights, kings, magical swords,
    and references to ancient spells. Characters in fantasy stories often live in a pre-industrial setting with limited
    technology, other than the advantages of magical power.
    <br>
    <br>
    The basic elements of fantasy have existed for centuries, and fantasy has roots in ancient myths, legends, and fairy
    tales. The course toward modern fantasy, however, began in the Victorian era when writers began developing their own
    distinct fantastical worlds, rather than building on established cultural tradition.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Is it good to imagine of things which are not possible to achieve in reality? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Imagination is the ability to form mental images of things, ideas or stimulation with no input from the five
    senses. It’s your imagination that allows you to fantasize or dream of something you want that is not in your
    reality yet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most poeple use their imagination to build pictures of a better lifestyle or what they want to hace in life and
    to predict something positive or negative that may happen. As we practice deliberately using our imagination, it
    will enhance our creative abilities, which means we will have better thoughts about our life. It helps to develop
    visions of what is possible, which means it will give clearer picture of our needs and the life we want to live. It
    will build up more self-confidence and improve our health and wellness by reducing stress. It helps to cut through
    mental clutter and noise.
    <br>
    <br>
    Using imagination makes it possible to experience reality in a world inside our mind. A well-developed
    imagination will make us a powerful creator and allow us to shape the future that we want. Hence it is good to
    imagine of things which are not possible to achieve in reality.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Do you talk to yourself when you are in a trouble? If yes, how does it help you?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes I talk to myself when I am in a trouble. I talk to myself everyday! I don't know exactly since how long I have
    been doing that but all past years that I recall I admit I have done it. And guess what! I love to.
    <br>
    <br>
    It helps me in many ways. I have so much to tell myself and maybe things that I wouldn't say to anyone. Nobody
    understands me better than myself. I can just say anything and everything and not be judged! I think self-talk is
    good as it doesn't require any effort unlike maintaining diaries etc. Self-talk happens mostly when I'm thinking
    through ideas, when debating decisions, or when I need of a pep talk. I feel better doing self-talk as it gives me
    feel of presence of someone around me. It helps me to make decisions more easily and motivate me to do things I may
    be putting off. To sum up, I do self-talk to work through extreme emotions - including anger, sadness, confusion and
    stress - and to sort out personal conundrums.

    <br>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>b. Describe a strange dream that you have seen recently.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    I was 10 when this happened. One night, when I had gone to bed, I saw a dream. In a dream I woke up to hear a noise
    and looked to my open bedroom door, where I saw a dark figure staring at me with red eyes. Thinking that it was my
    mother, I had called out to her multiple times, each time getting louder and louder. By the third time I called out
    to her, her red eyes did not move and I was getting frantic, screaming out to my mom and hiding beneath my covers.
    <br>
    <br>
    Come to find out my mother was in the living room fast asleep and had woken up from my calls, running into my room.
    When I looked at her, the black figure had gone and I have not seen it since. But I guess I had always been afraid
    after that of what might be watching me or threatening to harm me at any given moment. I know that was a demon it
    was too dark and felt too evil.
