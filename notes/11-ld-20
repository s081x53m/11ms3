    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why did the author feel that she was lucky to be so na&iuml;ve of her freshman year at college?</span>
    <br>
    The author felt that she was lucky to be so naïve of her freshman year at college because the very ignorance
    navigated her to the path of wealth and status. Despite of being foolish, she got an opportunity to explore new
    things. So she felt lucky.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?</span>
    <br>
    She said that she went to college in the Stone Age because she compares her college year with her son’s college year
    she found a vast difference. When she was at her son's age, she was not familiar with todays science and technology. Looking at todays modern student using modern technologies with advanced application on mobile phone, she finds her time to be primitive. Due to this reason, she said that she went to college in the stone age.
    <br>
    <br>

        time?</span>

    Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How has the internet and social sites affected the lifestyle of the youths?</span>
    <br>
    The Internet has made the youths rely on nearly everything either little or big. It has made the life of youths
    easier forgetting to experience struggle and hard labor. With no exertion they'll plan
    undertaking work depending upon search engines and software hampering the extension of the skyline of pondering and
    innovativeness. Social sites have given them opportunities to be connected to different people but they are
    fragmented because they know each other virtually. Due to internet and
    social sites the youths have missed the actual pleasure of the discovering of a real world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What things about college life will Hayden really miss unlike his mother?</span>

    <br>
    <span>f. The writer says, &quot;I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented&quot;. Isn't this
        paradoxical? How?</span>
    <br>
    The line &quot;I worry that student today are more connected and more fragmented &quot; is really conflicting and
    paradoxical. The paradoxical sentence is unreasonable in surface level. However, in profound level, there is its
    philosophical importance. There is no such thing as a fracture in affiliation apart from the above line implies
    youth are related
    to each other mainly by pleasant locations. But, in real world there are far to at least one one other. They do not
    have particular person to particular person connection so they're divided. There is no openness to one another to
    acquire life's critical minute.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block
        them from gaining some of life&rsquo;s most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Technology is the machines and tools we use to convert natural or mental resources into things we need, like energy
    or algorithms. Technology can be used in so many
    different ways, positive and negative, that the answers have become as convoluted and complicated as human
    interaction. It follows, therefore, that some technology is right for children in a learning and social environment,
    and some technology is not.
    <br><br>
    Most of the schools and colleges are using modern devices like laptops and tablets as a means of teaching. So the
    students are also using the same devices to be on par with the teachings of the teachers. In the present day, social
    media has evolved leaps and bounds, with 90% of the world’s population using social
    media. So the devices which are provided to the students for studying are instead used to be active on social media.
    Students are not studying with the help of these devices, they are interested in checking the posts and status
    updates of their near and dear ones and many other things. This is how technology is becoming a huge distraction for
    the learners, thus increasing the gap between students and educators.
    <br><br>
    In the present day, due to the huge advancement of technology, teachers are educating the students with different
    online tools instead of physically communicating with them, hence the students are unable to interact with the
    students and also cannot share problems with them. Teachers miserably fail to draw the attention of the student. It
    is recommended to use verbal communication with the students along with using online tools. So the students can
    learn the topics as well as they can share their problems with the teacher.
    <br><br>
    Thus its true that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block
    them from gaining some of life&rsquo;s most memorable moments.

    <span>b. Kline&rsquo;s essay focuses on the contrast between her son&rsquo;s freshman college experience and her
        own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The essay entitled “Taking my son to College, Where Technology has Replaced Serendipity” written by Christina Baker
    Kline is about the contrast between her college experience and her son’s experience. But the essay also includes the
    common things between her and her son. She talks about the experience of freshman college year in the same
    university. Although technology has replaced the way they do everything but still the education system was all same.
    All the old feelings and emotions were also the same. There were much more difficulty on her time comparing to her
    son&rsquo;s age but still,
    friendships and team working has not changed. She discusses the experience of green bean school year in a similar
    college. In this way, she also establishes the things they have in common.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Has the internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers?
        How?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Internet is a global network of interconnected networks of computers. It makes it easier and quick for people to
    access information sitting at any corner of the world. Just like any other technology, internet too has its own
    share of positive and negative effects on society. If internet is used to gain and explore knowledge, it is
    broadening of knowledge, but if
    you started relying on interent answers with blunt creativity, it is narrowing of the critical thinking capacity.
    The world of internet is so infinite that it can seem overwhelming. All forms of media don’t work in every setting.
    There needs to be a balance of modern technology in life, or you run the risk of losing out on developing
    fundamental skills.
    Internet is an excellent boost to your critical thinking skills, but you should be aware of some of the pitfalls
    that come along with it.
    Thus depending on how you’re using it, internet can be enhancing or damaging to critical thinking.
