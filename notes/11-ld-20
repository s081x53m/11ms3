    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer these questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why did the author feel that she was lucky to be so na&iuml;ve of her freshman year at college?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    When a person thinks s/he knows everything, the tendency to search for the extra knowledge starts vanishing. When we
    don't know anything else, we start exploring for knowledge and wisdom. Hence, she feels so lucky to be naive in her
    freshman year at college because being foolish, she got an opportunity to explore new things.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Technology was not such a use at her time. Compared to the present time, she was not so lucky to use cell phones,
    electronic gadgets to the fullest like his son is doing now. Seeing her son, using electronic devices and technology
    almost everywhere, she says that her time was so primitive, hence she said she went to college in the stone age.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. What kinds of technological tools can Hayden use at his college life unlike at his mother&rsquo;s time?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Hayeden uses every technological shortcuts to make his living easier. Wherever it is possible, he imposes the usage
    of technology whether it is a small thing or big. He utilizes cell phones for exploring applications, Facebook,
    Twitter. Instagram, Youtube etc
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How has the internet and social sites affected the lifestyle of the youths?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Internet has made the youths rely on nearly everything either big or little. With no exertion they'll plan
    undertaking work depending upon search engines and software hampering the extension of the skyline of pondering and
    innovativeness. Social locations have provided them possibilities to be related to varied people; nonetheless
    they're divided on the grounds that they know earth differently. They do not meet them in real life, Due to net and
    social locales the younger have missed the actual pleasure of the discovering of a real world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What things about college life will Hayden really miss unlike his mother?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Unlike his mother, Hayden will miss real life interactions, usage of thinking capability and imagination,
    exploration and discoveries of various things in life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. The writer says, &quot;I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented&quot;. Isn't this paradoxical? How?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The line &quot;I worry that student today are more connected and more fragmented &quot; is really conflicting and
    paradoxical. There is no such thing as a fracture in affiliation apart from the above line implies youth are related
    to each other mainly by pleasant locations. But, in real world there are far to at least one one other. They do not
    have particular person to particular person connection so they're divided. There is no such thing as a openness to
    at least one one other to accumulate life's vital minutes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life&rsquo;s most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    In this day, the web is probably the most influential source. It has become an important part of human life.
    Thinking about the existence of the life without web and technology is hard to imagine. Still it has small drops.
    One of them, it prevents students from opening school and deprives them of important moments of life. I totally
    agree with this assertion of the fact that firstly it prevents them from seeing the hardships and difficulties of
    labour, otherwise it makes them weak in using their brain power in investigation and action, thirdly it stops them
    from exploring this current reality just as you enjoy it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Life without labour, hard work, dedication and pain is definitely not a perfect life. A life of illiteracy is a good
    opportunity to meet the learning phase. Students must make a concerted effort to pass the test and need to make a
    concerted effort to broaden their understanding of the concept because the fact that once it stops them prevents
    them from seeing difficulties and difficulties, it makes them weak to use their new brain staff in research and
    practice, and thirdly prevents them from doing. So, Explore this current reality as they have a wonderful time

    <span>b. Kline&rsquo;s essay focuses on the contrast between her son&rsquo;s freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    An article titled &quot;Taking My son to College, Where Technology Has Taken Out Serendipity&quot; written by
    Christina Baker Kline is about the difference between her understanding of school and her child's knowledge.
    However, the text also includes the basics between her and her child.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though technology has replaced the way they do everything. Still, the education system was all same. Feelings
    emotions were the same. There were much more difficulty on her time comparing to her son&rsquo;s age but still,
    friendships and team working has not changed. These things are all same in some way. Exploration about the new
    things ware limited to physical doings, but now at the time of his son, the exploration and research is still the
    same, but it is done via technology medium, via search engines, E-books rather than physical books. Relationship and
    friendship was the struggle for freshman at her time, still search for the companion was prominent. This thing still
    prevails in electronic form from facebook, instagram and social media.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Has the internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers? How?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Everything has two sides, if you use internet to gain and explore knowledge, it is broadening of knowledge, but if
    you started relying on interent answers with blunt creativity, it is narrowing of the tinking capacity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Many people use the internet in Nepal. This means that many people who rely on web innovations hide their
    limitations of thinking. The vast majority of people are interested in it and expect it to make their lives easier.
    From casual work to extreme extremes like a clinic, web design use.
    <br>
    <br>
    A few groups argue that it enhances speculation and that the fundamentals of youth and students. Obviously there are
    a few benefits to the web but we should see the number of people who rely on the web to take care of any specific
    problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my view, it reduces the basic limit of consideration for young people or abusers. It limits the thinking skills
    of young children because they are at the bottom of the web in each issue.
    <br>
    <br>
    Instead of understanding books and irrational suspicions, when they find some difficulty they try to find provisions
    on the web. An example is when a teacher gives their students homework, pulls out their phone or jumps on their PC
    and tries to find a Google search setting and potential answers.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hence, I opine internet is nothing but a shortcut for mind labour.
    <br>
