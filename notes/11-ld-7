<h3>Critical thinking</h3>
<br>
<span>a. Do you think that the title &ldquo;Foresters without Diplomas&rdquo; is suitable to the essay? How?</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes I think that the essay's title, "Foresters without Diplomas," is appropriate.  The writer and her team initially summoned the foresters to show how they grow trees to the ladies. Because they possessed degrees, the foresters proved to be very difficult to work with. They developed complicated ways for coping with outwardly basic tasks like as searching for seeds and growing trees. Finally, the writer and her colleagues instructed the ladies on how to do the task using common sense, which they accomplished. They were able to search the area for seeds and learn to identify seedlings as they germinate from seeds that had fallen to the ground. Women did not have the same opportunities as males.
<br><br><br>
<span>b. Can a person make a difference in a society? Discuss with an example from a person who has made a difference in your society.</span>
<br>
<br>
It’s easy to feel like one can person can’t make a difference. The world has so many big problems, and they often seem impossible to solve. We know that while many common ways to do well, such as becoming a doctor, have less impact than you might first think; others have allowed certain people to achieve an extraordinary impact. In other words, one person can make a difference, but you might have to do something a little unconventional.
<br><br>
Numerous folks have made outstanding and significant change, not only for our society, but the entirety of all people, the world over. Some of those examples are Dr. Jonas Salk found the vaccine that prevented people from contracting Polio, Thomas Edison discovered the light bulb, a major innovation to society, the world over. So we can see that a person can make a positive difference in the lives of people not in our society but throughout the world.
<br><br><br>
<span>c. Write an essay on 'The Community Forest in Nepal'. Describe how these community forests have contributed to maintain ecology in our environment.</span>
<br><br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The Community Forest in Nepal</p>
<br>
The Community Forestry Program in Nepal is a global innovation in participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies, institutions, and practices. The program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction. As more than 70 percent of Nepal's population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, community management of forests has been a critically important intervention. 
<br><br>
Through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades, the program has evolved from a protection-oriented, conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use, enterprise development, and livelihood improvement. By April 2009, one-third of Nepal's population was participating in the program, directly managing more than one-fourth of Nepal's forest area.
<br><br>
The immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources. Community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks.
<br><br>
However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups. Lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.
