    <h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
    Since the title of the poem is clear, here we find Corona saying something to humans. The main speaker
    here in this poem is Corona. Here, this pandemic Corona has been personified as masculine gender. As a
    speaker, he is speaking to the human. He is continuously claiming, blaming, warning and even making
    humans realize about their misdeeds against this beautiful planet, its nature and other creatures.
<br><br>
    There are altogether six different stanzas here in this poem. In the very beginning, we find the speaker
    speaking to a man. The speaker asks the man to stop cursing him. He denies coming to this planet of his
    own free will and even taking thousands of lives and destroying the world's economy. He claims that he
    was invited without having his choice by humans' bad conduct and attitudes towards nature. Here, the
    speaker calculates dead people and even blames humans for their destructive wars and their bad
    impacts.
<br><br>
    Later on, the speaker blames humans for their useless arrogance. He states that the people on this earth
    think of themselves as 'the crown of creation' (king/ superior of this nature). Due to this arrogance,
    they are treating other creatures as their slaves. The speaker raises the value of all the creatures as
    birds in the sky, creatures in the sea, creeping insects on land, sources of life etc. on this planet.
    
<br><br>
    Due to all these bad activities of humans, the mother (earth) itself is feeling the burden. The speaker
    makes all the humans realize the clean blue sky without dust and smoke after his arrival. He has shown
    the mirror of reality to all the humans saying about the feeling of caged animals in a zoo. This is
    similar to the trapped life of humans during the period of lockdown. He claims that he had come to
    provide little rest to the mother (earth). 
<br><br>
    The speaker adds that the mother (earth) belongs to everyone not only the humans. Finally, he warns the
    humans to get rid of their egos otherwise many others like speaker will come here on this planet and
    humans have to return to the cave as before. 
<br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Understanding the text</h3> 
<br>
    <span>Answer the following questions:</span>
<br>
    <span>a. Who is the speaker in the poem?</span>
<br>
    &#10140; The speaker in the poem is Corona who has created devastating impacts on human life in this
    modern world.
<br><br>
    <span>b. Who claims that they are superior to all?</span>
<br>
    &#10140; The humans of this modern world claim that they are superior to all. Their egos have played a
    vital role in their thoughts as well as acts.
<br><br>
    <span>c. Why has the speaker come to the Earth?</span>
<br>
    &#10140; Actually, the speaker hasn't come to the Earth by his own free will. He has been invited
    instead. He has been here to provide a little rest to the mother (Earth) and make humans realize that
    the earth isn't only their property.
<br><br>
    <span>d. What positive changes have occurred on Earth after the speaker's visit?</span>
<br>
    &#10140; During the pandemic the sky has been clean without dust and smoke. People have felt like caged
    animals do in a zoo. The disease has allowed the earth to have a little rest. 
<br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
<br>
    <span>a. What does the speaker mean when he says: </span>
<br>
    <i>
        But have you ever counted 
        <br>
        How many have died so far 
        <br>
        Because of you and your wars?
    </i>
<br><br>
    &#10140; In the given lines, the speaker claims that human beings themselves are responsible for wars
    and loss of their lives. The devastation caused by wars is more terrible than the pandemic has done.
<br><br>
    Wars are the result of disputes over resources and land, or of a government's desire to increase its
    influence and power. The governments and any groups involving in wars never think of the consequences
    people have to face. Millions of people have lost their lives and properties because of wars.
    Aftereffects of wars cause them to suffer physically and psychologically.
<br><br><br>
    <span>b. Explain the following:</span>
<br>
    <i>
        I will depart one day.
        <br>
        But remember
        <br>
        There&rsquo;re many others like me.
        <br>
        They&rsquo;ll come too.
        <br>
        If you don&rsquo;t get rid of your inflated ego,
        <br>
        You&rsquo;ll be back to your cave time
        <br>
        That you endured
        <br>
        Long, long, long ago &#8230;
    </i>
<br><br>
    &#10140; In the given extract, the speaker warns mankind that the pandemic can be controlled but they
    may suffer from other fatal diseases due to their own behaviours, and finally they can be the cause of
    the extinction of human civilization.
<br><br>
    No country has remained untouched by the pandemic. However, no pandemic can be beyond human control.
    This happens because of human wisdom and the same wisdom is the origin of fatal diseases. The way humans
    treat the nature is gradually leading human civilization to its decline. When we go beyond the bearing
    capacity of nature, we will go to our primitive age.
<br><br><br>
    <span>c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines? Explain.</span>
<br>
    <i>
        The earth is not your property alone -
        <br>
        It&rsquo;s as much ours as yours.
    </i>
<br><br>
    &#10140; In the given lines, the speaker argues that the earth is the common habitat of all the living
    creatures. They have an equal right to use the resources available on earth, to sustain their lives, but
    human beings deprive them of using resources.
<br><br>
    The speaker is worried about growing human pressure on natural world. Human beings are thought to be
    superior to all the living creatures. They have controlled all the natural resources for their own
    benefits though the earth is the common home for all the living organisms. In the name of development
    and progress, humans are destroying the sources of food and habitats of other creatures. To fulfill the
    demands of growing population, human beings are disturbing the entire ecosystem. The loss of ecosystem
    causes the extinction of other living creatures.
<br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3> 
<br>
    <span>a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people's lives?</span>
<br>
    &#10140; The human behaviours are the sole cause behind all these sufferings of the people. Due to human
    egos and bad deeds, the present world is facing a crisis. Many people have lost their lives during this
    critical period. Due to their selfish nature, the earth and its people have faced numerous problems of
    diseases. Their so-called egos and wars have snatched the lives of many people.
<br><br><br>
    <span>
        b. How does an epidemic differ from a pandemic? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human
        life and environment.
    </span>
<br>
    &#10140; An epidemic is a widespread disease that affects many people in a population whereas pandemic
    is a disease that affects a wide geographical area and a large proportion of the population.
<br><br>
    Coronavirus is considered as one of the unforgettable threats of the twenty-first century. This disease
    has snatched the lives of people at a very high level. People in the world are panic-stricken and living
    their life in mental fear. Covid-19 has created devastating results in humans' history. Due to this
    pandemic. People are seen sanitizing the environment every time.
