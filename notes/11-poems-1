    <center>Corona Says</center>

    <br>


    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    Since the title of the poem is clear, here we find Corona saying something to humans. The main speaker
    here in this poem is Corona. Here, this pandemic Corona has been personified as masculine gender. As a
    speaker, he is speaking to the human. He is continuously claiming, blaming, warning and even making
    humans realize about their misdeeds against this beautiful planet, its nature and other creatures.
    <br><br>
    There are altogether six different stanzas here in this poem. In the very beginning, we find the speaker
    speaking to a man. The speaker asks the man to stop cursing him. He denies coming to this planet of his
    own free will and even taking thousands of lives and destroying the world's economy. He claims that he
    was invited without having his choice by humans' bad conduct and attitudes towards nature. Here, the
    speaker calculates dead people and even blames humans for their destructive wars and their bad
    impacts.
    <br><br>
    Later on, the speaker blames humans for their useless arrogance. He states that the people on this earth
    think of themselves as 'the crown of creation' (king/ superior of this nature). Due to this arrogance,
    they are treating other creatures as their slaves. The speaker raises the value of all the creatures as
    birds in the sky, creatures in the sea, creeping insects on land, sources of life etc. on this planet.

    <br><br>
    Due to all these bad activities of humans, the mother (earth) itself is feeling the burden. The speaker
    makes all the humans realize the clean blue sky without dust and smoke after his arrival. He has shown
    the mirror of reality to all the humans saying about the feeling of caged animals in a zoo. This is
    similar to the trapped life of humans during the period of lockdown. He claims that he had come to
    provide little rest to the mother (earth).
    <br><br>
    The speaker adds that the mother (earth) belongs to everyone not only the humans. Finally, he warns the
    humans to get rid of their egos otherwise many others like speaker will come here on this planet and
    humans have to return to the cave as before.

    <span>Answer the following questions:</span>
    <br>
    <span>a. Who is the speaker in the poem?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The speaker in the poem is Corona.
    <br><br>
    <span>b. Who claims that they are superior to all?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The humans of this modern world claim that they are superior to all.
    <br><br>
    <span>c. Why has the speaker come to the Earth?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The speaker has come to Earth as a result of the abuse of nature by people.
    <br><br>
    <span>d. What positive changes have occurred on Earth after the speaker's visit?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; After the speaker’s visit, the sky has been clean without dust and smoke. People have felt like caged
    animals do in a zoo. The disease has allowed the earth to have a little rest.
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. What does the speaker mean when he says: </span>
    <br>
    <i>
        But have you ever counted
        <br>
        How many have died so far
        <br>
        Because of you and your wars?
    </i>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; In the given lines, the speaker blames that the human beings themselves are responsible for wars and loss
    of their lives. The consequences and effects caused by wars is more terrible than the pandemic has done. Wars are
    the result of disputes over resources and land, or of a government's will to increase its influence, power and
    authority. The parties or government involving in wars never think of the consequences people have to face. Millions
    of people have lost their lives and properties because of wars. Aftereffects of wars is also causing them to suffer
    physically and psychologically.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Explain the following:</span>
    <br>
    <i>
        I will depart one day.
        <br>
        But remember
        <br>
        There&rsquo;re many others like me.
        <br>
        They&rsquo;ll come too.
        <br>
        If you don&rsquo;t get rid of your inflated ego,
        <br>
        You&rsquo;ll be back to your cave time
        <br>
        That you endured
        <br>
        Long, long, long ago &#8230;
    </i>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; In the given extract, the speaker warns us to terminate our egoistic behaviour. No matter who we are, we
    have to preserve the nature and shouldn’t go against the law of nature. By saying the above line the poet awares us
    that the pandemic can be controlled but they may suffer from other fatal diseases due to their own behaviours, and
    finally they can be the cause of the extinction of human civilization.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    <i>
        The earth is not your property alone -
        <br>
        It&rsquo;s as much ours as yours.
    </i>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; In the given lines, the speaker denotes that the earth is the common habitat of all the living creatures.
    All of them have an equal right to use the resources available on earth, to sustain their lives. But we human beings
    are ruling over others thinking ourselves as superior and depriving them of using resources. The speaker is worried
    about growing human pressure on natural world. They have controlled all the natural resources for their own benefits
    though the earth is the common home for all the living organisms. In the name of development and progress, humans
    are destroying the sources of food and habitats of other creatures. In this way, slowly and slowly entire ecosystem
    is being destroyed.
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people's lives?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The human behaviours are the main cause behind all these sufferings of the people. Due to human egos, their
    greediness and bad deeds, the present world is facing a lot of crisis. Many people have lost their lives during this
    critical period. Due to their selfish nature, the earth have faced numerous problems of diseases. Their so-called
    egos and wars have snatched the lives of many people. Hence, human beings themselves are responsible for suffering
    in people’s lives.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>
        b. How does an epidemic differ from a pandemic? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human
        life and environment.
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; An epidemic is a widespread disease that affects many people in a population whereas pandemic is a disease
    that affects a wide geographical area and a large proportion of the population. Epidemics occurs when an agent and
    susceptible hosts are present in adequate number and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the
    susceptible hosts.
    <br><br>
    Coronavirus is one of the greatest threat of the twenty-first century. This disease has taken away the lives of
    numerous number of people. People in the world are panic-stricken and living their life in mental fear. Businesses
    are down and economic crisis is seen all over the world. Many peoples are jobless, homeless and due to the scarcity
    of food also many peoples are dying. But due to the impact of Corona Virus, environment is clean and pollution free
    than before. As peoples are caged inside their houses, many of the industries are closed and the numbers of vehicles
    on the road is also decreased. Due to this the environment is cleaner and fresher than before.
