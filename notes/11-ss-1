    <center>The Selfish Giant</center>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    The story starts with the children playing in the garden of the Giant every afternoon after coming from
    school. The
    garden was lovely, large, with soft grass, and fruit trees. The trees bore rich fruits and birds sang
    sweetly sitting on
    them.
    <br>
    <br>
    One day after seven years the giant came back. He was staying with his friend, the Cornish Ogre. The
    children were
    scared to see him. He saw the children playing and said that he would not allow anyone to play here as
    it was his own
    garden. He built a wall around it and also put a notice board. The notice board displayed a warning on
    it,
    &lsquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rsquo;.
    <br>
    <br>
    The children became sad as they had no other place to play. They would wander around the high walls of
    the garden and
    remember the beautiful garden inside them.
    <br>
    <br>
    The spring season came and there were blossoms and little birds all around. But it was winter in the
    giant&rsquo;s
    garden and there were frost and snow. In the absence of children birds also did not sing. Once a flower
    bloomed out of
    the grass but after seeing the notice board, it also went back to sleep. Then came the North Wind and
    the hailstorm. Due
    to the giant&rsquo;s selfishness, autumn&rsquo;s golden fruits also did not come to his garden.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then one morning, the giant heard sweet and lovely music. It was a linnet singing outside his window.
    The hail and the
    North Wind stopped and he could feel the spring. He saw that the children came into his garden through a
    little hole.
    The children were sitting on the branches of trees and the trees were blossoming. He also saw the birds
    flying and hear
    them chirping. The flowers had also come up.
    <br>
    <br>
    But, to his surprise, in one corner there was still winter. He saw that there a young boy was standing
    and he was not
    able to reach the branches of trees. The tree lowered its branches but still, he could not climb.
    <br>
    <br>
    At this scene, his heart melted. He realized that he was really very selfish. He decided to put that boy
    on the top of
    the tree, pull down the walls, and allow children to play here forever. But when the children saw him,
    they ran away and
    the garden became winter again. However, that little boy did not run as he was weeping. The giant put
    him on the top of
    the tree and the tree blossomed at once. He kissed the giant.
    <br>
    <br>
    The other children realizing that the giant is not wicked came back. The spring came back with them. The
    giant used to
    play with the children ever afternoon but that little boy was nowhere to be seen. As the years went by,
    he grew very
    weak. One winter morning, he saw a lovely tree with white blossoms in a corner. The branches of the tree
    were golden and
    the little boy stood under it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The boy was wounded which made the giant very angry. He told the boy that he will slay the man who has
    harmed him. The
    boy told him that these were the wounds of love. The boy smiled and asked the giant to come to his
    garden. Later, the
    children found the giant dead under the tree covered with white blossoms

    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The practice of representing the objects, qualities etc. as the human beings in art and literature is called personification. Three examples of personification from the story are the beautiful little flowers who slips back into the garden after seeing the notice board, the snow and the frost who says that the spring has forgotten this garden. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The story has the significance of the seasons personified. At the beginning, the seasons bless the garden with pleasant weather until the Giant sends the children away from his garden. Because of the Giant's unkindness to the children, the spring season leaves the garden. The seasons disfavor indicates that the Giant's selfishness goes against the natural order and thus deserves punishment. Thus the significance of the seasons personification is to show that if someone does bad then he/she will deserve the bad.

    &#10140; The story ‘The Selfish Giant’ is a fairy tale. Here, the children symbolize innocence, love, compassion and blessings. Likewise the seasons represents life and death. The tree symbolizes patience and hope. The corner of the garden depicts the paradise. Finally the snow, the wind and the frost symbolize pain, suffering and discomfort.

        D. Which figure of speech is used for &lsquo;winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little

    <h3>Reference beyond text</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. What is the main theme of the story?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The main theme of this story is selfishness and love. It is the story of transformation of selfish giant into selfless giant. At the beginning of the story, the giant was very selfish and wicked towards the children and he closes the gate of beautiful garden for them. But later he realizes his mistake when the children stop coming to the garden and the garden never experiences the spring season until and unless he allows them to play in his garden. At this point he realizes the meaning of love and sharing. This story is very much relatable to the nature of human beings. We hardly share our belongings to anyone if somebody is needy and we are selfish too. This story teaches us to share love and compassion to get love in return.
    <br>
    <br><br>
    <span>b. Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140;Yes, God punishes those who are cruel to children and very selfish. As in the story, Giant has really been so cruel to the children and selfish and he didn’t let them play on the garden because of which spring never came in his garden. In the absence of children birds also did not sing. Once a flower bloomed out of the grass but after seeing the notice board, it also went back to sleep. Then came the North Wind and the hailstorm. Due to the giant’s selfishness, autumn’s golden fruits also did not come to his garden. In this way god punishes to those who are cruel to children and very selfish.
