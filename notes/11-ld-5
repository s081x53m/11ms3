    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. Why was the doctor not ready to go to see her husband?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The doctor was not ready to go to see her husband because for the last three days he had been away, seeing

    <br>
    &#10140; The story possesses the theme of devotion, loneliness, escape, fear, love, dedication, hope, defeat and
    independence.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. &ldquo;The looking glass (mirror)&rdquo; is used as a symbol in the story. What does it symbolise?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Nellie's inventiveness and desire to marry are symbolised by the Looking Glass. The mirror plays an
    important role in the narrative since it acts as a doorway into her mind. The majority of the narrative focuses on
    Natalie's dream and how it continues to frighten her due to her inability to solve the issue.
    <br>

    <br>
    The looking-glass provides Nellie with a way to escape her current situation. A life in which she is a single,
    unattached lady who yearns to meet a guy who will love her and who will love her back. She is, in reality, looking
    for happiness via marriage. The storyteller uses her dream to show her internal struggle and her difficulties in
    sharing her issues with others.
    <br>

    <br>
    The looking glass or mirror stays significant in the narrative because it shows the future. This item is used by
    Chekhov to reveal Nellie's inner emotions, anxieties, and the way she continues to feel powerless. The story's
    success is due to the usage of the looking glass, which brings the story's aims and objectives to the attention of
    the readers.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b. Chekhov employs the magic trick in the story, using a very elegant transition from reality to imagination to
        reality sequence. Discuss its relevance to life of young people.
    </span>
    <br>

    <br>
    &#10140; The author has utilised a magic trick in the tale, utilising a very beautiful transition from reality to
    fantasy to reality. From the beginning of the narrative through the main character's dream recounted until the
    character wakes up, it proceeds methodically through the explanations.
    <br>

    <br>
    On New Year's Eve, this tale takes place. In the first section of the tale, the shift from reality to fantasy
    happens. The tale starts with a young lady called Nellie gazing into the mirror, constantly wanting to be married.
    She loses herself in her imagination and sees a terrible vision of the future in which she must rescue her spouse
    from typhus. The action gets increasingly detailed, and the readers may fairly conclude that they have entered the
    world of the imagination. And this is a brilliant move on Chekhov's side.
    <br>

    <br>
    We find ourselves at the section of reality at the conclusion of the tale. One of Nellie's gazing glasses slips from
    her grip and lands on the floor. She snaps out of her reverie. This is the point at which the changeover becomes a
    reality.
    <br>

    <br>
    The majority of young people want their lives to be like those in fairy tales, full of pleasure and perfection, and
    they fail to notice the tough aspects. They relate themselves to familiar figures from fantasy films. The
    protagonist in the tale had na&iuml;ve aspirations and great expectations at the start. What she sees through the
    glass dispels her delusion. Though she first sees love and the loving spouse of her dreams, she soon realises that
    this pleasure is fleeting. Nellie symbolises a group of privileged young women who are preoccupied with the
    possibility of romance and marriage. She considers romance to be the key to her happiness in life. She is unfamiliar
    with the harsh truths of life and death.
