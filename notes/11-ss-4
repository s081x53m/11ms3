                <br>

                Summary<br>
                This short story &quot;The Wish&quot; has been written by an English writer Roald Dahl. This story is
                completely based on the imagination of the main character who is a child. This story has presented the
                imaginative acts of this main character in an imaginative game of a red carpet.<br>
                <br>
                The story begins with a small boy who picks a scab off his knee. As he sits on the stairs, he happens to
                be aware of the large red, black, and yellow carpet that extends to the front door. He imaginatively
                tells himself that each different colour represents something else. The red parts of the carpet
                represent red-hot lumps of coal, that can burn him. The black parts are poisonous snakes that can bite
                him, and leave him to die. The yellow part is the only safe zone for him. If he gets across the carpet,
                he will be gifted a puppy for his birthday.<br>
                <br>
                The boy starts his quest. The first part is easy going. He reaches some difficult parts and has to take
                long steps. He wobbles but stretches out his arms to be steady himself. He comes to a turning point and
                goes left. Although it seems more difficult there&rsquo;s less black. He gets in the halfway point and
                knows he can neither turn back nor jump off.<br>
                <br>
                The boy steps on to the next yellow patch and his foot comes within a centimeter close to the black. A
                snake stirs and raises its head to look at him. Another snake rises as well. The child is frozen with
                fear for several minutes. The next step is too long to jump. He transfers all his weight to his front
                foot. He attempts to then bring up his back foot but can&rsquo;t. He gets stuck while doing splits.<br>
                <br>
                The boy tries to move back, but he can't. He is properly stuck. He looks down at the oily bodies of the
                snakes writhing underneath him. He starts to tremble, and tries to keep his balance by waving his arms.
                It doesn't work. He starts to fall over towards the black. He gives a loud cry when he touches it. His
                mother is looking for him out in the sunshine, far away behind the house.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Understanding the text <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. What did the child do to the scab on his knee?<br>
                &#10140; The child picked the scab off his cut and flipped it with his finger so that it flew away and
                landed on the edge of the carpet.<br>
                <br>
                b. What kind of effect did the carpet have on the child?<br>
                &#10140; The carpet made the boy enter into the world of imagination. The boy looking at the colourful
                carpet imagined the black patterns to be poisonous snakes, red parts to be burning coals, and yellow
                patterns to be the safe spots.<br>
                <br>
                c. What was he afraid of while walking across the carpet?<br>
                &#10140; He was afraid of the black poisonous snakes and the red coals while walking across the
                carpet.<br>
                <br>
                d. What motivated and encouraged the child to start and continue on his journey?<br>
                &#10140; His wish of getting a puppy on his birthday or as a birthday gift motivated and encouraged the
                child to start and continue on his journey.<br>
                <br>
                e. What did the child see as he looked down on the black patterns of the carpet?<br>
                &#10140; The child saw different colours brightening mysteriously. He was lost in different colours'
                spots. He kept on thinking in his imagination about the colours and their different forms. Hence, the
                child saw the poisonous snake with the oily body of snake arising to catch or bite him as he looked down
                on the black patterns of the carpet.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, the writer creates two voices in the story and they were (a narrator) and the voice of the
                young boy i.e. the child.<br>
                <br>
                b. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow. &ldquo;&#8230;the black parts are
                snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks around the middle, and if I
                touch one of them, I'll be bitten and I'll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without
                being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.&rdquo;<br>
                <br>
                i. What does &lsquo;the black part&rsquo; mean?<br>
                &#10140; The black part means the difficulty, challenges and suffering in the journey.<br>
                <br>
                ii. Who is the speaker?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker is a young boy.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Why doesn&rsquo;t the speaker want to be burnt?<br>
                &#10140; He doesn&rsquo;t want to be burnt because he wants to reach across the carpet safely to receive
                the gift &lsquo;a puppy&rsquo; on his birthday.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?<br>
                &#10140;In the story, imagery is built on metaphors. The first image Dahl presents is the scab which
                stands for a challenge. Because of the boy&rsquo;s overwhelming curiosity, the scab represents &ldquo;a
                special challenge he was never able to resist.&rdquo; This is his first metaphorical obstacle, and he
                becomes determined to pick the scab &ldquo;even if it hurts like anything.&rdquo; The initial success
                concerning the scab gives the child confidence and gives him the self-image of a hero, so he looks for a
                greater challenge.<br>
                <br>
                The central metaphor in the text is a carpet. The carpet stands for the world of imagination. The carpet
                makes the boy enter into the world of imagination. The boy looking at the colourful carpet imagines the
                black patterns to be poisonous snakes, red parts to be burning coals and yellow patterns to be the safe
                spots. On the other hand, the carpet is also a metaphor for the challenges that one has to face in the
                course of life. The child&rsquo;s journey across the carpet facing different obstacles implies
                one&rsquo;s journey in life full of obstacles.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. Summarize the short story &ldquo;The Wish&rdquo; in about 200 words.<br>
                &#10140; Scroll at top of the page<br>
                <br>
                e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles,
                who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?<br>
                &#10140; In &quot;The Wish,&quot; a boy uses his imagination to travel across a red, black, and yellow
                carpet that he pretends has treacherous parts, motivating himself with the fantasy of receiving a puppy
                if he is successful. The child's point of view is more interesting and effective than the narrator's,
                because it is vivid and suspenseful. The story is primarily about self-confidence overcoming fear rather
                than about greed.<br>
                Here, the child represents a more interesting and effective view for readers than the narrator because
                the child was a in a hardship situation and he faces hardships and won all the challenges as motivated
                by a Birthday gift as a puppy by completing his journey at the end.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                f. Is &ldquo;The Wish&rdquo; a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your
                arguments.<br>
                &#10140; Roald Dahl's &quot;The Wish&quot; is about self-confidence overcoming fear rather than about
                greed aa it is all about self-confidence and overcoming fear. Admittedly, &quot;greed,&quot; the desire
                for a puppy, is a motivating factor. However, the puppy motivator is a fantasy that boy has made up to
                help him overcome his fear of crossing the treacherous carpet. He says to himself, &lsquo;if I get
                across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday
                tomorrow.<br>
                <br>
                The child seems fearful while watching his scab. He thinks much about picking it. He raises many
                questions with himself. He picks out his scab being panic. But when he sees the carpet his fear
                increases high. He gathers his confidence to cross the carpet. He creates his obstacles supposing the
                colours as coals and snakes. He even puts his goal across the carpet. He moves on bravely on the carpet
                wishing for a puppy on his birthday as a birthday gift. He tries his best to overcome his fear. His
                self-confidence and his wish end as he falls down in black colours.<br>
                <br>
                Even the puppy becomes part of his project of overcoming fears to achieve a goal: But the fear of not
                getting the puppy compelled him to go on. This tale enters into the mind of an imaginative child and
                reflects the child's ability to turn something as common place as a patterned carpet into a scene of
                adventure and challenge in which he can act out his fears in a safe environment.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?<br>
                &#10140; Not all the wants, desire and wishes are fulfilled. We need hard and complicated practice to
                fulfil our wish, want, desire, and interest. We should be calm while making every decision. The right
                decision leads to the right path that only can fulfil our needs and desire.<br>
                <br>
                When we desire something that is called wish. Hard work is needed for wish to be fulfilled. But all our
                desire can't be fulfilled at all. All are not happy because their wish and desire are not fulfilled and
                when the wish will not fulfil they will be upset. Almighty helps in every condition.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, to fulfil our wish, needs, desire and satisfaction we should practice a lot then only we can
                be happy.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to
                overcome it?<br>
                &#10140; Some people might have a frightening nature because they do not have self-confidence. They lose
                their self-confidence easily as they face obstacles in their paths of life.<br>
                <br>
                I would suggest the following points to overcome it:<br>
                - Learn more about your fear, this first step can be the hardest one but it's also absolutely
                necessary.<br>
                - Use your imagination in positive ways.<br>
                - Use your brain in a different way than usual.<br>
                - Focus on your breathing.<br>
                - Practice mindfulness.<br>
                - Use nature as your therapist.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. Write a folktale that you have heard or read.<br>
                &#10140; <br>
                THE FARMER'S PRESENT<br>
                In a small village in Jumla, there lived a hardworking farmer. Once, he had grown a huge watermelon in
                his garden. It was the biggest anyone had ever seen. The farmer was very proud of his watermelon. He
                would gaze at the fruit for hours, thinking, &quot;It's one of its kinds! I shall take it to the market
                and sell it for a good price.&quot; Then the next moment, he would think, &quot;No... The market will
                not be the right place for my watermelon. I shall place it in an exhibition.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, the farmer decided to take his watermelon to the king. &quot;I can't wait for tomorrow! I am
                sure king will like my gift and reward me with whatever I wish for!&quot; With these happy thoughts the
                farmer went to sleep.<br>
                <br>
                The king had a habit of taking a walk through his kingdom at night, in order to check if all his
                subjects were safe. That night, disguised as a common man, the king passed by the farmer's house and
                suddenly spotted the huge watermelon in the garden.<br>
                <br>
                The king was so fascinated by the wonderful fruit that he knocked on the farmer's door and woke him up.
                &quot;Who are you and what do you want at this time of the night?&quot; asked the farmer. &quot;I am a
                poor man,&quot; replied the king, &quot;and I want your watermelon.&quot; &quot;THE WATERMELON!
                NO!&quot; said the farmer. &quot;Then what are you going to do with it?&quot; asked the king. &quot;I am
                going to present it to the king,&quot; replied the farmer. &quot;But what if the king doesn't like
                it?&quot; asked the king. &quot;Then may he go to the devil!&quot; snorted the farmer. The king left and
                the farmer went back to sleep.<br>
                <br>
                The next morning, he went to the place crying the huge watermelon. As soon as the farmer saw the king,
                he recognized him. But he pretended as if he knew nothing. He saluted the king and said, &quot;I've
                brought you a watermelon, your Majesty! This is the largest watermelon in the country. You will like
                it!&quot; &quot;Hmm!&quot; nodded the king. &quot;But what if I don't like it? &ldquo;<br>
                <br>
                &quot;Well... in that case... you already know my answer, your Majesty!&quot; said the farmer,
                softly.<br>
                <br>
                The king smiled, &quot;I accept your present, O farmer!&quot; said the king. &quot;It's the best gift
                I've ever received.&quot; The farmer was richly rewarded not only for his gift but also for his
                intelligence and wit.<br>
                <br>
