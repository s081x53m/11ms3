    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I believe Mrs. Wright murdered her husband. After reading the entire play, I believe she
    is a murderer. Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale discover a number of clues which point to Mr. Wright's cruelty.
    They examine her untidy kitchen, take note of Minnie's irregular stitching, discover a broken birdcage,
    and find a dead canary in Minnie's sewing box. They come to the conclusion that Mr. Wright killed her
    beloved pet, in her rage, she killed him in his sleep.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Do you think Mr. Wright&rsquo;s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn&rsquo;t stopped by
        the Wrights&rsquo; home?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; No, I don't think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by
    the Wright's home. If Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home, nobody would ever know about Mr.
    Wright's death. The location of the house was quite far from the road. Nobody had visited this lonesome
    house for a long time. If Mr. Hale hadn't stopped there to ask for a telephone line, Mr. Wright's dead
    body would have been decayed in that gloomy house.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>
        c. Why does Mrs. spanHale think that Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s worries about her preserves indicate her
        innocence?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Mrs. Hale thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because
    Mrs. Wright does not strike her as a murderer who is obsessed with her housekeeping abilities. According
    to her, a person who is overly concerned with her preserves cannot possibly commit murder. Her attention
    to detail in her housekeeping skills demonstrates her innocence.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>d. How does Mrs. Peters&rsquo; homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Mrs. Peters' homesteading experience connects her to Mrs. Wright in the following ways:
    <br>
    1. She lost her kitten while she was a girl. A boy killed it with a hatchet in front of her eyes. She
    became quite angry with the boy. A sense of revenge was seen within her against the boy. This experience
    connects her to Mrs. Wright's revenge against the killer of her canary.
    <br><br>
    2. She lost her first baby of two years old. She had spent her tough time without her lovable baby. This
    experience connects her to Mrs. Wright's tough time which she spent without her lovable canary.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. How do the women&rsquo;s perspectives on men differ?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The women believe that each of them has suffered a similar circumstance in a male dominated
    society. It lets them understand the plight of Mrs. Wright easily. They consider that Mrs. Wright is
    worthy of their protection. While men are looking for evidence, women worry about the trifles. They find
    the motive behind the murder. They become sympathetic to Mrs. Wright and hide the evidence. They unify
    with Mrs. Wright against the law.

    <br><br><br>
    <span>d. Discuss the symbolism used in the play.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Symbolism is a literary device that refers to the representation of a concept through symbols
    or underlying meanings of objects or qualities. Here in this play, we find various things that symbolize
    varieties of hidden meanings. The symbolism used in the play are as follows:
    <br><br>
    <b>1. The preservative jars:</b> The preservative jars in the kitchen are broken due to the cold. These jars
    symbolize the cold and broken marriage relationship between Mrs. Wright and her husband. Due to their
    weak relationship, nothing is in a good state.
    <br><br>
    <b>2. Singing Canary bird:</b> The singing Canary bird symbolizes the freedom of Mrs. Wright before her
    marriage. She was just like a canary bird known as Minnie Foster, a popular singer thirty years
    back.
    <br><br>
    <b>3. The birdcage:</b> The birdcage here in this play symbolizes the trapped life of Mrs. Wright after her
    marriage. Her life remained within the boundaries of her house. Its broken state symbolizes the poor
    condition of the gloomy house.
    <br><br>
    <b>4. Wrung neck of canary:</b> Here, wrun neck of canary symbolizes the concept of revenge in a tit for tat
    manner. Mr. Wright has also been murdered with a rope around his neck instead of a gun.
    <br><br>
    <b>5. Knot in a quilt:</b> Mrs. Hale's dialogue as the knot in a quit symbolizes the murder with a rope. The
    stitches in the particular quilt even symbolize the nervousness of Mrs. Wright.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an impact on the theme of the play?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; This play is set in Mr. John Wright's abandoned farmhouse. The house is a lonesome, gloomy
    place down in the hollow where the road cannot be seen. The setting of the play contributes to our
    understanding of Mr. Wright's position because it implies that she was depressed or unhappy just by
    judging from the way her house looks. The setting of Trifles also helps us understand the characters and
    also moves the plot.
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>

        but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in relation to the characters

    <br><br>

    through on stage characters like Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters. Here, these two on-stage characters keep on
    discussing and informing us about various aspects of Mrs. Wright's life. Their discussion related to

    of all the readers. Mrs. Wright has got the sympathy of all the readers.

        in a play; it creates tension and suspense. Analyse the play discussing the author&rsquo;s use of
        dramatic irony based on these questions:
    </span>
    <br><br>
    <span>&#9899; What information is crucial to the play Trifles?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Dramatic irony is a literary device that has been created when the audience or reader comes to

    <br>
    &#10140; To create dramatic irony, the playwright uses this information very tactfully creating various
    twists, suspense, readers' interest and revelation in a very interesting way. The playwright keeps on
    presenting information related to murder through predictions and proofs which the characters make and
    get during the time of investigation to find the actual murderer.
    <br><br>
    <span>&#9899; What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Dramatic irony is very well managed and presented by the playwright. It has put the audience
    and readers above the leading male characters of the play. It has managed all the readers' attention,
    anticipation, hope, fear, curiosity and suspense. Here, the readers have got the actual information
    before all male characters of the play. Dramatic irony has made this play very interesting and full of
