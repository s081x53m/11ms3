    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I believed that Mrs. Wright killed her husband. After listening to the conversation of two womens they were comparing Mrs. Wright before marriage life and after marriage life. By this we can understand that Mrs. Wright had very wonderful life before marriage and after marriage, her life was boring. She couldn't sing talk to anybody, depressed and her bird was killed by her husband. So, in case of revenge she killed her husband.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Do you think Mr. Wright&rsquo;s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn&rsquo;t stopped by
        the Wrights&rsquo; home?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; No, I don't think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wright's home because if  Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home, nobody would ever know about Mr. Wright's death as the location of the house was quite far from the road and the news of his death will remain suppressed.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>
        c. Why does Mrs. spanHale think that Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s worries about her preserves indicate her
        innocence?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Mrs. Hale suggests think that Mrs. Wright’s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because she did not feel happy and she contrasts Mrs. Ale saying that only an innocent woman would ask for an apron and a shout while worrying about fruit. So because of this, Mrs. Ale thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocent.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>d. How does Mrs. Peters&rsquo; homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Mrs. Peter end up protecting Minnie Wright by hiding the strangled canary, which could be used as key evidence against her. Although Mrs. Peter's is the sheriff's wife and married to the law she comes to the same conclusion as Mrs. Wright and ultimately acting on her behalf. In this way Mrs. Peter's home steading experience connects her to Mrs. Wright.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. How do the women&rsquo;s perspectives on men differ?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The woman's perspectives on men differ by the fact that the mens are powerful and have become stupid and lazy but the women have no power except that of intelligence, which allows them to manipulate the men.
