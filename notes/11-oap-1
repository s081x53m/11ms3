Mr. Henry Peters is the sheriff.<br>
<br>
Summary <br>
The motive for the story is to expose the killer of John Wright. The characters suspect whether homicide should be committed by his wife or by someone else. The male characters doubt Mrs. Wright. So they focused on finding evidence in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The story begins in the farmhouse of John Wright. The kitchen looks dirty.The District Attorney, the Sheriff and Mr. Hale entered the house. They were followed by Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters. Women are standing at the door. They do not meet the men who are close to the fire and getting warm. <br>
<br>
The district attorney ensures that nothing is involved in the house. He begins to investigate Mr. Hale by asking him about the events of that day. Mr. Hale learns about the death of Mr. Wright. Mr. Hale responds by saying that he visited Wright's home to inquire whether he will join Hale going to Telephone. He says that Mrs Wright was sitting on a rocker going up and down. <br>
<br>
She was holding an apron in his hand and she looked nervous. He found her behaving strangely. When he asked her where his husband was, She said her husband died at the top with a rope around his neck. She said someone strangled her husband while he was asleep. Henry Peter comes to help Mr. Hale . <br>
<br>
Mr. Hale brings the Sheriff - Henry Peters (whom he calls Harry) to see the dead Mr. Wright upstairs. Henry went to bring the case detective (the officer in charge of investigating the violent, sudden or suspicious death). When Mr. Hale tells her about telephone, she laughed. Then she looks scared. <br>
<br>
George Henderson investigates in the kitchen. The glass jar of fruit preservatives is broken because of the cold. It has made the cupboard messy. Mrs. Peters interrupts that Mrs. Wright was worried about it. Mr. Hale says that the women worry over the trifles.<br>
<br>
Henderson criticizes Mrs. Wright for the dirty towels and unmanaged stuff in her home and also comments on her house making skills. The men then go upstairs in search of evidence.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peter gather things for Mrs. Wright - specially clothes for her since she was arrested in a hurry the day before. Henderson allows Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters to gather a few things for Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Hale arranges the pan in the kitchen disturbed by men during their investigation. She does not like men criticizing women.<br>
<br>
They take clothes for Mrs. Wright from her closet. Mrs. Hale remembers Mrs. Minnie Wrights as an unmarried Minnie Foster.<br>
<br>
She was very happy then. She used to sing passionately. She was no longer happy after her marriage. She has now asked only for her apron and a shawl. She is worried about her fruit preservative.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peter says that her husband suspect how could a wife not wake up during a murder. Mrs. Hale mentions that her husband found a gun in the house. It is suspicious to use a rope to murder instead of the gun. Mrs. Peters finds a large sewing basket. It has bright pieces. She was piecing a quilt. She was following a log cabin pattern in which the fabric is pieced around a center square. Mrs. Hale wonders if she was going to quilt it or just knot it!<br>
<br>
The men go to the barn in search of evidence. They laugh listening to the women's discussion about the blanket to be quilted or knotted. Dismiss it as trifle.<br>
<br>

Half of the dish-towel is clean, Loaf of bread outside the bread box, Unfinished quilt, One block of the quilt is made untidier than the other stitches (Shows nervousness). Mrs. Peters looks in a cupboard to find paper and string to complete the quilt but instead finds a birdcage without a bird. Mrs. Hale remembered a man who sold canary. Maybe a cat has got it. But Mrs. Wright did not have a cat. She was upset when Mrs. Peters' cat went into her room. The door of the cage was broken.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale worries about not visiting Mrs. Wright all these days. She knows Mr. Wright was a hard man.<br>
<br>
They do not have children. So the house must be quiet. Mr. Wright goes out for work all day. She was not in good company when he was at home. So Mrs. Wright must have had the canary as her companion.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale says about Mrs. Wright, &quot;She was kind of like a bird herself-real sweet and pretty, but kind of timid and fluttery&quot;. But she has changed after her marriage.<br>

<br>
Horrified to see that its neck is wrung.<br>
<br>
Men enter from the farmhouse.<br>
<br>
The women hide the box among the quilt pieces.<br>
<br>
Mr. Henderson mocks them, asking whether the blanket is to be quilted or knotted.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters answers decisively that Mrs. Wright must have planned to knot it.<br>
<br>
The men find no evidence in the farmhouse<br>
<br>
The rope is from Wright's home itself.<br>
<br>

<br>
Mrs. Hale says Mrs. Wright was trying to bury the bird that she loved in the pretty box.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters remembers her childhood days, when a boy killed her kitten with a hatchet.<br>
<br>
She was furious to hurt the boy but she was not allowed to do so.<br>
<br>
Mr. Wright did not like the bird to sing. He must have killed it. He also stopped Mrs. Wright from singing.<br>
<br>
It is awful that after many years of emptiness, the only bird that sang was killed.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters shares the stillness (emptiness) when her first baby died two years old.<br>
<br>
However she feels the law has to punish Mrs. Wright for the crime of killing her husband.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale becomes nostalgic.<br>
<br>
Recounts Mrs. Wright in white dress with blue ribbons singing in the choir.<br>
<br>
She is guilty for not visiting her.<br>
<br>
Consider it as a crime which has to be punished.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale decides not to tell anyone about the broken fruit preservative.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters wraps the bottle of preservative that is not broken in a petticoat.<br>
<br>
They do not wish to hurt Mrs. Wright anymore.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters knows that men would just laugh at times for getting upset over the dead canary.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hale says, &quot;We live close together and we live far apart. We all go through the same things, it's all just a different kind of the same thing&quot;.<br>
<br>
The men enter saying that they need definite evidence.<br>
<br>
Mr. Henderson is not satisfied. He wishes to stay in search of any other clue as they could not proceed with the case.<br>
<br>
Mr. Peters informs Mr. Henderson to verify the belongings of Mrs. Wright taken by Mrs. Peters.<br>
<br>
Mr. Henderson checks at random as the women may not have taken any dangerous things.<br>
<br>
Moreover, Mrs. Peters is also tied to law being the sheriff's wife.<br>
<br>
The sheriff and the coroner go to have a look at the window in the other room for any evidence.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hale goes out.<br>
<br>
Mr. Henderson mocks at whatever women do as trifles<br>
<br>
Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale conceal the Truth.<br>
<br>
MRS PETERS throws back quilt pieces and tries to put the box in the bag she is wearing. It is too big. She opens the box, starts to take the bird out, cannot touch it, goes to pieces, stands there helpless. Sound of a knob turning in the other room is heard. MRS HALE snatches the box and puts it in the pocket of her big coat. And, here ends the play.<br>

<br>
b. Do you think Mr. Wright&rsquo;s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn&rsquo;t stopped by the Wrights&rsquo; home?<br>
Ans. Mr. Hale is initially learning of Mr. Wright's death. It's conceivable that if Mr. Hale hadn't dropped by the house of the Wrights, his death wouldn't have long been discovered. As few people visit the farmhouse, she may have been able to conceal the corpse and hide the death of her husband.<br>
<br>
c. Why does Mrs. Hale think that Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence? <br>
Ans. Mrs. Wright takes care of the fruits, apron, scarf, etc. They make Mr. Wright happy. They're the home emblems she once adored. Her concerns about these things reveal her real nature. This makes Mrs. Hale feel innocent.<br>

They unite against legislation with Mrs. Wright.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference to the Context<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
e. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an impact on the theme of the play?<br>
Ans : This drama is set at the abandoned farmhouse of Mr. John Wright. It's a lonely, dull and chilly spot down in the depression, where the road cannot be seen. Yes, it has an impact on the subject of the play. This setting showed the lives of modern American women who were formerly constrained by the responsibilities of their husbands. They used to live inside the boundaries of their houses in seclusion and confinement. The setting of the home even implies that males dominate women.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference beyond the text<br>
a. The credibility of a character is determined not only by the character&rsquo;s thoughts and actions but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in relation to the characters of Trifles.<br>
<br>
Ans : By stages like Mrs Hale and Mrs Peters, we as readers are brought to Mrs. Wright's primary off-stage persona. These two characters on the stage continue to debate and tell us of many elements of the life of Mrs. Wright. <br>
<br>
In their examination, Mrs. Wright's discussion disclosed many previously unknown elements of Mrs. Wright's life. Thanks to women's knowledge, we may learn about Mrs. Wright's life and suffering. Readers are engaged in knowing about their life narrative emotionally. Both ladies and Mrs. Wright's descriptions seem unbelievable. Their contributions to the play made all readers happy with Mrs. Wright. <br>
The work of these two characters, Mrs. Wright was favourably represented in the eyes of all readers. Everybody sympathises with Mrs. Wright.<br>
<br>
<br>
b. Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience has information that is unknown to the characters in a play; it creates tension and suspense. Analyse the play discussing the author&rsquo;s use of dramatic irony based on these questions:<br>
<br>
i. What information is crucial to the play Trifles? <br>
Ans : Dramatic irony is a literary apparatus when the audience or reader learns what was concealed before. The main characters in the drama do not know the facts, but the readers or the audience knows the facts. The key information in this play about dramatic irony is that Ms. Wright killed her husband. The readers know the circumstances behind the murder via Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, but these facts are not known to the male characters who seem to be concerned with discovering clues.<br>
<br>
ii. How does the playwright use this information to create dramatic irony? <br>
Ans : The writer utilises this knowledge with great sensitivity to generate dramatic irony, producing several twists, suspense and revelation. The writer continues to provide knowledge about murder by predicting and proving that the characters discover a real killer throughout the inquiry.<br>
<br>
iii. What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?<br>
Ans : The playwright is extremely good at managing and showing dramatic irony. It raises the audience and readers above the major male characters in the drama. The attention, expectation, hope, anxiety, curiosity and suspense of the readers were preserved. The readers now have precise information on all the men in the game. This drama has been extremely fascinating and full of turns where evidence has been presented that makes readers interested.<br>
