A Red, Red Rose<br>
<br>
By Shriram Lamichhane<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
&ldquo;A Red, Red Rose&rdquo; is a romantic poem written by evergreen writer Robert Burns. This writer is very genius and knows actually what he is writing. He is very clear with his thoughts and stick to his aim. He is simply guiding youth about how to impress any girl.<br>
<br>
Love is the chief point in this poem. Everything in this world goes around love. Love is the only sacred thing which takes nothing more than a two pure hearts. If two hearts are beating for each other then surely no power or no storm can make them different. This poem is nothing but the lines written by a man who knew impulsively how to prevail a woman&rsquo;s heart. There so much hidden in this poem which is necessary to learn. Really the poem sounds great as it gives reader a true guidance and tells them to work for love.<br>
<br>
The reader may get previously well-known with the poem&rsquo;s much-quoted initial headline. Its plea over time most likely shoots from the valor of its contention, the speaker&rsquo;s love is expressed through the predictable picture of the flower rose and during the line&rsquo;s four sturdy beats.<br>
<br>
The poet&rsquo;s preference for a rose may initially look stale, along with the color &ldquo;red&rdquo; may look too apparent a sign of love and enthusiasm. Thus, far if the relationship between the adored one and the rose limits on line, a vigilant reading explores the subtler modes in which the speaker communicates about his passion.<br>
<br>
Why, for example, is the expression &ldquo;red&rdquo; constant? The answer for this might be found in the next line. Since red is estimated color of the flower, the reappearance of the adjective stands for the complete and most lovely sign of the flower rose, it&rsquo;s a perfect state.<br>
<br>
New spring season speaks about the romantic climate and the things goes even good if two loving hearts are close to each other. In a love life it is more important to make opposite person happy and thus for this it is necessary to do small things which can make her happy. Offering a rose is the same thing and it can even increase love. The speaker gives an exact guidance through his lines and each and every word that he has used.<br>
<br>
This poem is significant concerning the sturdy yet caring love on a moan headed for a lady. The poet applies the regular thoughts about love by using word like &ldquo;Red Roses&rdquo;. As the flower rose signs love, zealous and sturdy relation.<br>
<br>
The poem tells the meaning of love, and it is durable to believe those reminiscences if fall in love to somebody. Robert Burns sought to get married with his love that was pregnant by his twins; however the father-in-law would not agree to it. Burns turned into a legendary success and did really revisit to marry his first love. It is said that this is a true story that he has lived, and therefore he is very passionate about love and inspiring others to get bind into true love.<br>

Understanding the text<br>

<br>
b. What does the speaker promise in the second and third stanzas?<br>
Ans; The speaker promises enduring love in the second and third stanzas. He has used some examples to express his feelings. He mentioned that he would love his lover until the sea dried up and until humanity is destroyed.<br>
<br>
c. What imagery does he use in his promise, and why do you think he uses such language?<br>
Ans; The speaker exaggerated his love for his beloved by using various illustrations. For example, he said he would love her until the sea dried up, the rocks melted and the sun and until the sands of life ran. In short, he tried to explain to his loved one the unconditional love, the pure, the true, and the never-ending love.<br>
<br>
d. In the last stanza, what event is about to happen by mentioning the number of miles?<br>
Ans; From the last section, we can open the word that one love partner is going away from the other.<br>
<br>
e. Which image in the poem do you find the most memorable or surprising and why?<br>
Answers ;. Robert used visual aids in the poem such as, &quot;O my Luve is like a red rose, red&quot;, &quot;And the rocks melt 'in the sun' and&quot; While the sands o 'life will run &quot;. Among these, the Red Red as a picture of her love is what I found most amazing and interesting. She resembles her love through the image of a rose, and her innocence or the intensity of love using a reddish color that doubles, intensifying her love for her loved one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference to the context<br>
a. What can you infer about the speaker&rsquo;s devotion to his beloved from the following lines?<br>
And I will come again, my love,<br>
Tho&rsquo; it were ten thousand mile!<br>
Ans; From the given lines of the poem I can point out that the speaker is completely devoted to his loved one. He has promised his sweetheart that he will return to her wherever he goes, no matter what the distance. Even if her relationship is 10,000 miles away, his love will never die, he will continue to love her. All in all, these lines represent the immortality of his love for his beloved.<br>
<br>
b. What is the theme of the poem?<br>
Ans; The most important theme of &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot; is the power of love. The speaker makes it clear that he will like what he likes no matter what. His love is so deep that it will never be extinguished.<br>
<br>
c. Paraphrase the whole poem into simple prose form.<br>
Ans; The speaker describes his love - which means the person he loves or the speaker's feelings of love for that person - as beautiful, vivid, and fresh as a flower that has just blossomed. This love is as sweet as the melody of a talented artist.<br>
<br>
A loved one is so beautiful that the speaker loves him with a deep and powerful love - it is so strong, in fact, that the love of the speaker will last until the sea dries up.<br>
<br>
Even though the sea and the land are rotten and rotten, the speaker will still love the loved one. This love will last until their lives are over and even for the rest of one's life.<br>
<br>
The speaker concludes by saying good-bye to the loved one - that is, the speaker reminds him, the only person the speaker loves. The speaker wishes him well but while they parted for a while. The speaker reaffirms his loyal love by promising to return even if the trip covers a considerable distance and lasts a long time.<br>
<br>
d. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions, and feelings and also help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyse the poem in terms of the literary devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.<br>
<br>
Ans; Literary analysis shows that with the help of these typewriters the poet painted a vivid and realistic picture of his deep love. Robert Burns has used some of the writing material in this poem to show the lovely beauty and intensity of his love. An analysis of some of the texts used in this poem is listed below.<br>
<br>
Assonance: Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in the same line as the sound of / i / in &ldquo;I will still love you, my love&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
Parable: Two parables are used in this poem. The first is used in the first line, &quot;O my Luve is like a red rose, red&quot; Here, the poet compares his lover to red roses. The second is used in the third line, &quot;O my Luve is like music&quot;, and the poet compares his love to beautiful music.<br>
<br>
Symbolism: Symbolism means using symbols to show ideas and attributes, giving them symbolic meanings that are different from their true meaning. Robert used the word &ldquo;rose&rdquo; as a symbol of affection.<br>
<br>
Alliteration: Alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line as the sounds of / l / and / r / in &ldquo;O My Luve is like a red, red rose&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
Images: Images represent a distinct representation of something that can be detected or understood by five senses. Robert used visual imagery in poems such as, &quot;O my Luve is like a red, red rose&quot;, &quot;And the rocks melt the sun&quot; etc.<br>
<br><br>
e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.<br>
Ans; A motto is a device used to exaggerate a statement for the purpose of emphasis. The poet used exaggeration in the last line of the second paragraph, &ldquo;Till the sea is dry. He says his love will flow even when the sea is dry. The second is used in the third passage, &quot;And the rocks melt with the sun.&quot;<br>
<br>
f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.<br>
Ans; The lines that are repeated a certain distance in poetry are called refrain. The line, &ldquo;And I will still love you, my darling&rdquo; has become a line, as you repeat in the second and third paragraphs.<br>
<br><br>
Reference beyond the text<br>
<br>
a. What kind of love is expressed in &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot;?<br>
Ans; Robert Burns expresses romantic love in &quot;A Red, Red Rose.&quot; As the title of the poem shows, she is at a high level of being head-loving on the heels. The red, red rose is a metaphor for her feeling that her love is in full bloom. It is very high, just as the rose is in June.<br>
<br>
b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?<br>
Ans: Yes, I believe that the power of love has great power. Love is the most powerful and powerful force of love that can tear down relationships and build up the same; it all depends on what effect it gives whether it is bad or good. Love has the power to heal wounds.<br>
<br>
Poets compose poems and talk to their lover because they hear the poem by putting themselves in the poem. They feel it all and give the form of death in the poem, the emotions in the poem.<br>
<br>
c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.<br>
<br>
Ans; Poetry is a type of writing based on a combination of words and rhythm. Poets and philosophers have the power to describe the closest moments of human life. Poets have the power to pour out their feelings in poetry and to describe deep emotions and spiritual movements. They likewise translate emotions into solid language that reflects the same complex and hidden truths of the human soul.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is not only a joy that poets can relate to their verses, but also grief, despair, grief, pain, doubt, hatred, love, compassion, desire, praise, faith, respect, and hope. They can also convey all the feelings and emotions, in general, that may have a place in a person's soul. Therefore, poetry can be understood as the expression of feelings and emotions.<br>
