    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The speaker describes his or her love&mdash;meaning either the person the speaker loves or the speaker's
    feelings of love for that person&mdash;as being as beautiful, vivid, and fresh as a flower that has just
    recently bloomed. This love is as sweet as a beautiful song played by a skilled musician.
    <br><br>
    The beloved is so beautiful that the speaker loves her with a deep and strong passion&mdash;so strong,
    in fact, that the speaker's love will last until the oceans have become dry.
    <br><br>
    Even after the seas have evaporated and the earth has decayed, the speaker will still love the beloved.
    This love will endure until their own lives have ended and even until all human life has ended.
    <br><br>
    The speaker concludes by saying goodbye to the beloved&mdash;who is, the speaker reminds her, the only
    person the speaker loves. The speaker wishes her well during their temporary separation. The speaker
    reaffirms his or her faithful love by promising to return even if the journey covers a very long
    distance and takes a very long time.
    <br><br><br><br><br>

    <br>
    &#10140; He uses the imagery of dry seas, melted rocks, ended human life in the second and third stanza.

    <br>
    &#10140; Here in this poem, I find the most surprising image of the dry seas throughout the world,
    because the speaker's promise is managed in a very interesting way. I keep on pondering the state of the
    earth without water after reading his lovable promises.
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. What can you infer about the speaker&rsquo;s devotion to his beloved from the following lines?</span>
    <br>
    <i>And I will come again, my love, Tho&rsquo; it were ten thousand mile!</i>
    <br>
    &#10140; This beautiful promising line has been taken from Robert Burns love poem ' A Red, Red Rose. We
    find this line at the end of the fourth stanza. Here, the speaker is in deep love with his beloved. He
    is making a promise with his beloved to return to her life after their temporary separation. He promises
    to be with her no matter how long the journey is.
    <br><br><br>

    <br>
    &#10140; The poem has the themes of love and passion. The poem is basically concerned with the

    <span>
        d. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions, and feelings and
        also help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyze the poem in terms of the literary
        devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; The poet employs several literary devices to show the beauty of his beloved and the power of
    his love. They are simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.
    <br><br>
    The first literary tool used in the poem is simile. It is an expression which describes one thing
    comparing it with another, using words as or like. The poem begins with two similes. They are used when
    the speaker compares his beloved with a red rose and sweet melody.
    <br><br>
    Symbolism is another figure of speech, used in the poem. The rose is a traditional symbol of love. In
    the poem, the rose symbolizes love between the speaker and his beloved. This symbolism dates back to
    ancient Greek literature, which associates the rose with Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love.
    <br><br>
    In the poem, imagery is created with simile and hyperbole. There is a visual picture of a red rose in
    our mind when the speaker compares his beloved with a red rose. When he equates her to the sweet melody,
    auditory imagery is used. Comparisons of both the rose and the melody shows his beloved lovely, sweet,
    new, and young. To convey the intensity of his affection, he then switches to hyperbolic images, by
    expressing that he will love until the seas become dry and the rocks melt in the sun. We can view the
    world of dry seas and melted rocks in our mind.
    <br><br>
    The poet makes use of alliteration and assonance to emphasize his powerful feelings of love for his
    beloved.
    <br><br>
    Alliteration is found in the line &lsquo;O, my love is like a red, red rose.&rsquo; It has the
    repetition of the consonant sounds /l/ and /r/. Assonance is a literary device in which the repetition
    of vowel sounds occurs in the same line. In the line &lsquo;And I will love thee still, my dear&rsquo;,
    the vowel sound /i/ is repeated.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Hyperbole is a literary technique which is used to exaggerate a sentence. The poet used this
    literary device to present the intensity of the speaker's affection. In the second and third stanza we
    find the use of hyperbole where the speaker claimed, &quot; And I will love thee still my dear, Till a'
    the seas gang dry&quot; &quot; And the rocks melt wi' the sun!&quot;, &quot;While the sands o' life
    shall run.&quot; Here, the speaker seems to be exaggerating his emotions in these lines to illustrate
    his desire to love her forever. The last two lines, &quot; And I will come again, my love, Tho' it were
    ten thousand mile!&quot; The speaker exaggerates the distance to demonstrate his firm love feelings.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Refrain is a poetic device in poetry that focuses only on repeated lines at a certain distance.
    It is used to emphasize something and to produce rhythm in the poem as well. It is used to break up
    stanzas. We find a refrain here in this poem in the second, third, and fourth stanzas.
    <br>
    The refrain in the poem are as follows:
    <br>
    And I will love thee still, my dear,
    <br>
    Till a' the seas gang dry.
    <br>
    And fare thee weel
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. What kind of love is expressed in &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In this poem, A Red, Red Rose, the poet has expressed his romantic love for his beloved where
    his feelings are so deep. He has compared his beloved with a new and beautiful rose of July and also
    with a sweet melody. He has even made many promises to love his beloved forever.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I think love has power. Love can sometimes lead people towards perfection whereas it may
    bring destructive results too. I think poets are so passionate about their creations. Most of the poets
    in the world prefer writing about love relationships. We find most of the poets composing their poems
    addressing their beloved because they want to write their own experiences of love and share with others.
    Their own experience of love supports them to create the best they can.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Poetry is the representation of thoughts and feelings that enables people to express themselves
    in writing. Poetry is a perfect way to relieve emotions, practice imagination, and exchange ideas and
    thoughts with others. Writing poetry in just a few words is an art, a way of communicating and seeking
    meaning. A melody of passion that flows through the pages, words that flow into each other and still
    convey the innermost feelings and emotions of those who read the words. Via a few lines of verse, poets
    can readily express their inner thoughts and emotions. The poets' works have a profound sense of human
    thoughts and emotions. The poetic lines create incredible definitions of the feeling of man.
