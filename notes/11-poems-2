    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The speaker describes his or her love&mdash;meaning either the person the speaker loves or the speaker's
    feelings of love for that person&mdash;as being as beautiful, vivid, and fresh as a flower that has just
    recently bloomed. This love is as sweet as a beautiful song played by a skilled musician.
    <br><br>
    The beloved is so beautiful that the speaker loves her with a deep and strong passion&mdash;so strong,
    in fact, that the speaker's love will last until the oceans have become dry.
    <br><br>
    Even after the seas have evaporated and the earth has decayed, the speaker will still love the beloved.
    This love will endure until their own lives have ended and even until all human life has ended.
    <br><br>
    The speaker concludes by saying goodbye to the beloved&mdash;who is, the speaker reminds her, the only
    person the speaker loves. The speaker wishes her well during their temporary separation. The speaker
    reaffirms his or her faithful love by promising to return even if the journey covers a very long
    distance and takes a very long time.

    <br>
    &#10140; He uses the imagery of dry seas, melted rocks, ended human life in the second and third stanza and an image of a long journey in the fourth stanza. I think he uses such language because his love is so deep and true for his beloved.

    <br>
    &#10140; The most memorable or surprising image I find in the poem is of the dry seas throughout the world, because the speaker's promise is managed in a very interesting way. 
    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. What can you infer about the speaker&rsquo;s devotion to his beloved from the following lines?</span>
    <br>
    <i>And I will come again, my love, Tho&rsquo; it were ten thousand mile!</i>
    <br>
    &#10140;  This beautiful promising line has been taken from Robert Burns love poem ' A Red, Red Rose. We find this line at the end of the fourth stanza. Here, the speaker is in deep love with his beloved. He is making a promise with his beloved by saying that no matter how long the journey is he will return to her life.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. What is the theme of the poem?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The most important theme of "A Red, Red Rose" is the power of love. The speaker makes it clear that he will like her no matter what will enter between them. His love is so deep and inestimable that it will never be extinguished.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. Paraphrase the whole poem into simple prose form.</span>

        d. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions, and feelings and
        also help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyze the poem in terms of the literary
        devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; The poet employs several literary devices like simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance to show the beauty of his beloved and the power of his love.
    <br><br>
    The first literary tool used in the poem is simile. It is an expression which is used to compare an object or a person with something else to make its meaning clean to the readers. There are two similes used in this poem. They are used when the speaker compares his beloved with a red rose and sweet melody.
    <br><br>
    Symbolism is another literary device which is used to signify ideas and qualities giving them symbolic meaning. Here the poet has used ‘rose’ as a symbol of love.
    <br><br>
    Imagery is a distinct representation of something that can be understand through five senses. Robert has used visual imagery in the poem such as a red rose.  There is a visual picture of a red rose in our mind when the speaker compares his beloved with a red rose. When he equates her to the sweet melody, auditory imagery is used. To convey the intensity of his affection, he then switches to hyperbolic images, by expressing that he will love her until the seas become dry and the rocks melt in the sun. We can view the world of dry seas and melted rocks in our mind.
    <br><br>
    Alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line such as /l/ and /r/ in “O my Love is Like a red, red rose.”
    <br><br>
    Assonance is a literary device in which the repetition of vowel sounds occurs in the same line. In the line ‘And I will love thee still, my dear’, the vowel sound /i/ is repeated.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Hyperbole is a literary technique which is used to exaggerate a statement for the sake of emphasis. The poet has used hyperbola in the last line of the second stanza, “Till a' the seas gang dry”. He says that his love will flow even when the seas dries up. The second one is in the third stanza where the speaker claimed, “And the rocks melt wi' the sun”.  Here, the speaker seems to be exaggerating his emotions in these lines to illustrate his desire to love her forever.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Refrain is a poetic device in poetry that focuses only on repeated lines at a certain distance. It is used to reinforce the main them on point of a poem. It is also used to emphasize something and to produce rhythm in the poem as well. We find a refrain here in this poem in the second, third, and fourth stanzas and they are as follows:
    <br>
    - And I will love thee still, my dear
    <br>
    - Till a' the seas gang dry
    <br>
    - And fare thee weel
    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. What kind of love is expressed in &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In this poem, A Red, Red Rose, the poet has expressed his romantic and inestimable love for his beloved. He promises to love his beloved until the earthly seas have become dry, rocks have melted by the heat of the sun and human life has ended and makes it clear that he will love her till his last breath.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I think that love has power. In fact I consider love as a most powerful thing that exists in the entire universe. Love is the thing that bounds people and keep them together. Love can sometimes lead people towards perfection whereas it may bring destructive results too. Most of the poets compose their poems addressing their beloved because poem is the beautiful and best medium to express the feeling of a person. Expressing love in poem adds more beauty to the story than in another form. Thus the poets compose poems addressing their beloved.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Most of the literary works of extraordinary merit have been written through the means of poetry. Poetry is the representation of thoughts and feelings that enables people to express themselves in writing. Poetry is a perfect way to express love, emotions, imagination, and exchange ideas and thoughts with others. Poetry holds power to explain those intimate moments of the life of human beings. It’s not only a joy that poets can relate to their verses, but also grief, despair, grief, pain, doubt, hatred, love, compassion, desire, praise, faith, respect, and hope. Therefore, poetry can be taken as the expression of feelings and emotions.
