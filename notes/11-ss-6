    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The story 'Two Little Soldiers' is about a triangular love with a completely unexpected twist at the
    end. Luc and Jean are the major characters of the story. They are soldiers and spend their free time on
    Sundays away from the barracks, in the countryside. Their outing has taken on the character of a ritual.
    Every Sunday, they bring food to the same place in the woods and lie back to enjoy the food, wine, and
    sights of an area that reminds them of home.
    <br>
    <br>
    Their ritual comes to take in a bit of innocent gazing of a young village girl who brings her cow to
    pasture and milks it every week at the same time. One Sunday, the girl talks to them on her way to the
    pasture. When she returns later, she offers them the cow&rsquo;s milk and leaves them with a promise to
    meet the following Sunday.
    <br>
    <br>
    The next weekend, Jean suggests that they should bring something for her. They buy candies as a suitable
    present. When the girl arrives, they don&rsquo;t dare to give her the candies. Finally, Luc tells the
    girl that they have brought something for her. Jean hands the little paper bag to her.
    <br>
    <br>
    As the weeks pass, the girl turns out to be the topic of conversation for two soldiers when they spend
    time at the barracks. The three become fast friends. They tell each other little incidents and details
    of their villages. The girl begins to eat their meal with them and appears to devote equal attention to
    them. Then, in an unexpected move, Luc seeks leave on a Tuesday, and again the following Thursday. He
    borrows money from one of the friends but offers no explanation for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The following Sunday the girl appears as she always does. When she is near them, Luc gets up and goes
    towards her. Then, she kisses him passionately. Jean is upset and heartbroken because he is left out and
    does not understand why the girl has suddenly turned all of her attention to Luc. He comes to know that
    why Luc had gone out twice during the week.
    <br>
    <br>
    Luc and the girl go together to attend to the cow and disappear into the woods for a long time. Jean
    remains motionless and panicky. When they return, they kiss again. She doesn&rsquo;t offer Jean any milk
    that day. Neither of the soldiers talks about the incident.
    <br>
    <br>
    While returning to the barracks, they stop momentarily on the bridge over the Seine as usual. Jean leans
    over the railing. He falls into water. Luc can&rsquo;t do anything. He watches in grief as his good
    friend drowns. He runs to the barracks with his eyes full of tears.

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer these questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Why do the two soldiers spend their free time on Sundays away from the barrack out in the
        countryside?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The two soldiers Luc Le Gandec and Jean Kerderen spend their free time on Sundays away from the
    barracks out in the countryside because the countryside reminds them of their homes and they feel very
    happy there.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Why does the girl become the topic of conversation for these soldiers?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The girl becomes the topic of conversation of these soldiers because both of them have fallen
    in love with her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Why does deception enter into their friendship?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; As both Luc and Jean love the same girl, Luc without informing his friends leaves the barracks
    secretly to meet the girl. In this way, deception from Luc&rsquo;s side enters into the friendship
    between Luc and Jean.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Do you think that Luc is a betrayer of friendship?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In my opinion, Luc is a betrayer as he has broken the faith of his friend Jean. He leaves the
    barracks twice without telling anything to his friend so that he can meet the countryside girl whom Jean
    loves equally. Jean is heartbroken because of Luc&rsquo;s move. Therefore, Luc can be called a
    betrayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What is the cause of suicide of Jean? Do you think that it was the only release of his love?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Jean commits suicide because he is mentally disturbed seeing the love affair of his friend Luc
    with the girl whom he loves much and he is also depressed realizing the deceitful move of his friend
    Luc. I don&rsquo;t think suicide was the only one way to release his love. He could have talked to the
    girl or he could have moved on in his life instead of committing suicide.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. What is the central theme of the story?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The central theme of this story is the incompatibility between friendship and love. In simple
    words, the two best friends can&rsquo;t love the same person. If such situation arises, friendship
    weakens because of the entry of love. Luc and Jean are the best friends but the entry of the girl into
    their life weakens their friendship. While dealing with the theme of love, the writer also suggests the
    dynamism of love by focusing on two aspects of love: Platonic love between Jean and the girl and the
    physical love between Luc and the girl.
    <br>
    <br>
    Likewise, deception is another theme of the story. Deception is the act that hides the truth, or
    promotes a belief, concept, or idea that is not true. It is often done for personal gain or advantage.
    In the story, Luc deceives his friend Jean for personal gain or advantage. Without telling anything to
    his friend Jean, he leaves the barracks on Tuesday and Friday secretly, meets the girl privately and
    makes love. Even after to the barracks, he does not tell him anything. It is also because of this
    deceitful move of Luc, Jean commits suicide at the end of the story.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. &quot;What are you doing here? Are you watching the grass grow?&quot;</span>
    <br>
    <span>i. Who is the speaker?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The dairy maid is the speaker.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>ii. What does the word &ldquo;here&rdquo; indicate?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; &quot;Here&quot; means the place where the two soldiers visit every weekend.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>iii. Who does &ldquo;you&rdquo; refer to?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; &quot;You&quot; refers to the two soldiers Jean and Luc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        c. &quot;He leaned--he--he was leaning--so far over--that his head carried him away--and--he--fell--he
        fell----&quot;
    </span>
    <br>
    <span>i. Who is the speaker?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The speaker is Luc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>ii. Why is the speaker speaking with interruption?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The speaker is speaking with interruption because he is in pain and scared of the death of
    Jean.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>iii. What does he mean when he says &ldquo;he--fell--he fell---&rdquo;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; He means that Jean fell into the river.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Two Little Soldiers can be viewed as a series of dramatic scenes. Describe the story as tragedy.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; This short story &quot;Two Little Soldiers&quot; is a bizarre dramatic triangular love story
    which has been ended with a tragic incident. Here in this story, we find jealousy, betrayal, romantic
    love with change, discontent as well as mental conflict. The milkmaid has created enmity between two
    friends. She has become the main cause of Jean's fall down. We find both friends' intimacy and their
    enjoyment during their weekends. But, after the entry of milkmaid in their life, deception starts
    playing its role. We find deceptive acts of Luc Le Ganidec. Due to these immoral as well as deceptive
    acts of both lovers, Jean suffers a lot. When he gets realization about their affair, he becomes so sad
    both physically and mentally. He wants to cry being desperate. He feels himself a fool. The deception of
    both lovers makes him heartbroken. He finds them quite indifferent towards him. He doesn't reveal his
    painful feelings to them. He feels better to commit suicide than to stay with betrayers. The tragic
    death of Jean at the end of the story surprises the readers too.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What is the setting and style of the story?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Two Little Soldiers is set in the French countryside. The scene is peaceful. Luc and Jean, who
    are soldiers stationed in barracks nearby, are present there on Sundays with meal and to enjoy the area,
    which reminds them of their home. Maupassant is careful not to show too much of barrack life. The beauty
    of the setting is enhanced by the presence of a dairy maid.
    <br>
    <br>
    The most significant technique that Maupassant uses in the story is his manipulation of the point of
    view. Though the events of the story appear to be continuous, the point of view shifts as scenes change.
    Maupassant adopts the voice of an omniscient narrator. He tells the reader what both soldiers think and
    do, giving each equal attention, and provides simple and straightforward information about what the
    young girl feels or thinks in the first encounter. He relies on the viewpoint of one character, Jean
    when Luc decides to go on leave, and the two soldiers travel to the countryside for the last time. When
    the two soldiers return to the barracks, the scene is viewed through Luc&rsquo;s eyes. The reader is
    denied knowledge of Jean&rsquo;s feelings, and hence is given no explanation of his motivation for
    killing himself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. How would you describe the conflict between the friends?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; In the story the conflict arises when the girl kisses Luc passionately, without paying
    attention to Jean, without even noticing that he is there. Jean is upset and heartbroken. At this point,
    Jean discovers the reason why Luc seeks leave and borrows money from Jean but offers no explanation for
    his behavior. Luc and the girl go to attend to the cow and disappear into the woods for a long time.
    When they return, the lovers kiss again, and the girl doesn&rsquo;t offer him any milk that day.
    Eventually, the conflict between friendship and love leads to death of Jean. Luc remains in anguish as
    his good friend dies.

    <br>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. Is it good to have conflict between friendship and love? Is it morally good that a person and his
        best friend can love the same person?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; No, It is not good to have a conflict between friendship and love because these are the
    relationships which are very essential for an individual. True friends and loved ones always care for
    each other. They shed light on your qualities, both positive and bad, and improve self-esteem. Via
    laughter and good times, friends help relieve tension and hardship. They will help you move forward.
    <br>
    <br>
    As long as your love and intension are pure towards the person, it is not morally bad for two-person
    having the same feelings for the third one. Knowingly or unknowingly, this type of condition may arise
    in a person's life. Although it is not bad, possibilities are high for the problems to arise in the near
    future. So, the only solution is to talk with each other and solve the problem by controlling your
    emotions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How would you describe the triangular love?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; This short story &quot;Two Little Soldiers&rdquo; has presented the theme of friendship,
    romantic love, discontent, betrayal and jealousy. This short story is about a triangular love where the
    deception of a friend has created an unfortunate incident for the next friend.
    <br>
    <br>
    A triangular love (also called love triangle or a triangle of romance) is typically a romantic
    relationship involving three individuals. Although it can refer to two individuals romantically linked
    individually to a third, it typically indicates that each of the three individuals has some sort of
    relationship with the other two. It can be friendships, romantic, or family relationships.
