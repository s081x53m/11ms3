<h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
Jonathan Iwegbu has survived the Nigerian Civil War along with his wife and three of his four children,
and thus considers himself &ldquo;extraordinarily lucky&rdquo;. He also treasures his still-working
bicycle, which he buried during the war to ensure it would not be stolen. Another apparent miracle is
his still-standing home, which he repairs and reoccupies after returning home to the capital city of
Enugu. To explain both his good and bad fortune to himself and others, he often repeats a phrase:
&ldquo;Nothing puzzles God.&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
Jonathan works hard in the aftermath of the war, using his bicycle to start a taxi service and opening a
bar for soldiers. His family mirrors his example, cooking food and picking fruit for sale. Since the
coal mine where Jonathan worked before the war has not reopened, this resilience is crucial towards
securing even their minor comfort.
<br>
<br>
One day, after turning over rebel currency, Jonathan is given an award of 20 pounds. He takes care not
to be robbed, remembering a theft he observed several days earlier, in which a man broke down in public
over the indignity.
<br>
<br>
That night, a group of thieves knocks on his door demanding money. Frightened, the family calls for the
neighbors and police, but the heavy silence when they finish reminds them that nobody looks out for
anyone but himself. The thieves then mock them, crying out even louder to indicate how helpless the
family is.
<br>
<br>
The thief leader demands 100 pounds, promising not to hurt Jonathan or his family if he cooperates.
Eventually, Jonathan realizes their lack of options, and gives the thieves the 20 pounds of reward money
so they will leave the family unharmed. Some thieves insist they should search the house for more, but
the thief leader believes this is all Jonathan has, and accepts it.
<br>
<br>
The next morning, Jonathan and the family are back at work as the neighbors arrive. Sensing their
confusion over his ability to toss off the situation of the night before, Jonathan explains to his
neighbors that the reward money cannot compare to what he lost in the war. He chooses to focus on his
work in the present rather than regret what has happened, since &ldquo;Nothing puzzles God.&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Understanding the text</h3>
<br>
<span>Answer the following questions.</span>
<br>
<span>a. Why did Jonathan think of himself as &lsquo;extraordinarily lucky&rsquo;?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Jonathan thought of himself as &lsquo;extraordinarily lucky&rsquo; because he had survived the
Civil War along with his wife and children.
<br>
<br>
<span>b. What are the &lsquo;five blessings&rsquo; for which Jonathan is grateful?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The &lsquo;five blessings&rsquo; for which Jonathan is grateful are his head, his wife
Maria&rsquo;s head, and the heads of three out of their four children. That means he is grateful for the
survival of five family members.
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle? What does this tell you about the situation in Nigeria?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Jonathan mistrusted the officer who wanted to take his bicycle because the officer lacked a
certain grip and firmness in his manner. So, instead of giving his bicycle to the office, Jonathan gave
him two pounds and saved his bicycle. This episode of bribery indicates the corruption and dishonesty in
the army during the Civil war.
<br>
<br>
<span>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</span>
<br>
&#10140; The visitors who knock at the door of Jonathan&rsquo;s house late at night demanding money are
the thieves. Jonathan and his wife are completely surprised as it was midnight and the thieves are
knocking at the door violently. They are also afraid as they don&rsquo;t get any response from both the
neighbors and the police.
<br>
<br>
<span>
    e. Why does no one in the neighborhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan&rsquo;s door? Why do
    the thieves call for the police?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; No one in the neighborhood responds when the thieves pound on Jonathan&rsquo;s door because
they are scared of the thieves. Moreover, in the post-war era, there is the collapse of communal
solidarity. The thieves call for the police knowing that police won&rsquo;t come to help at
midnight.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference in the context</h3>
<br>
<span>
    a. What does Jonathan mean by his expression &ldquo;Nothing puzzles God&rdquo;? What does this
    expression reveal about his character? Explain by citing details from the story.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; In the story &quot;Civil Peace&quot;, Jonathan uses this expression &quot;Nothing puzzles
God&quot; whenever something miraculous happens with him. It indicates his deep religious faith in God
and pessimistic nature. Jonathan repeatedly utters the expression for positive outcomes - like the
survival of his home and family - as blessings or miracles, and in bad situations, like coal mine
closing and robbery. He is willing to accept that he cannot control the forces of fate, and instead
focuses on the future. He successfully manages the chaos of the war and its aftermath by accepting both
good and bad events as the will of God. By attributing events to God, he accepts his disability to
change things that have already come to pass. This makes him focus his determination on working for the
future instead of indulging in self-pity.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, his character was optimistic hopeful nature to believe in God and thinks that there will be
good for tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>b. How does Jonathan change as he experiences the conflicts in his life? Explain.</span>
<br>
<br>
&#10140; Jonathan is a hardworking person who believes in his hard labour as well as god the most. He is
quite an optimistic person who never loses his hope. He has experienced many conflicts in his life. He
has lost his child during the war but he believes himself lucky to get 5 inestimable blessings. Jonathan
keeps on doing his hard labour for the sake and welfare of his family keeping faith or believes in God.
He changes according to the demands of the time and his own family needs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Read the extract and answer the questions below.</span>
<br>
&ldquo;To God who made me; if you come inside and find one hundred pounds, take it and shoot me and
shoot my wife and children. I swear to God. The only money I have in this life is this twenty pounds
egg-rasher they gave me today ...&rdquo;
<br>
<br>
<span>i. Who is the speaker?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Jonathan is the speaker.
<br>
<br>
<span>ii. Who is the speaker talking to?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The speaker is talking to the thieves or robbers.
<br>
<br>
<span>iii. Who does &ldquo;they&rdquo; refer to?</span>
<br>
&#10140; &quot;They&quot; refers to the officials of the treasury i.e. the government.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    d. Nigerian English has words like soja 'soldier' and katakata 'confusion', 'trouble' derived apparently
    from English words but transformed by native languages' phonologies. What does the author&rsquo;s use of
    dialect here add to the story?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; Nigerian English has words like Soja &quot;soldier&quot; and katakata &quot;confusion&quot;,
&quot;trouble&quot; delivered apparently from English words but transformed by Native language
phonologies. Achebe has blended both standards and local languages to make the story real. He uses these
languages to differentiate the protagonist from the thieves outside his door. Their dialogue draws
significant attention to this inconsistency. The use of dialect has created authentic Nigerian
characters. He has invented a new form of English, a Nigerian English dialect to show the bicultural
heritage of his nation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    e. Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent
    than Jonathan does?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; The verbal exchange contrasts English spoken by the thieves in a heavier African accent and the
proper English spoken by Jonathan. The way thieves making fun of the family&rsquo;s call for help only
reinforces these differences. For example, the family cries out, &ldquo;We are lost!&rdquo; but in a
heavier English accent, this plea becomes &ldquo;we done loss-o!&rdquo; Achebe makes use of English with
an African accent for three reasons. The differences between speeches suggest that Jonathan is better
educated than thieves. Also, the use of English accurately reflects the eastern Nigerian society.
Lastly, the broken English is used to produce comedic effect.
<br>
<br>
<span>
    f. The title of the story &quot;Civil Peace&quot; itself is ironical as there is little to differentiate
    &lsquo;civil peace&rsquo; from &lsquo;civil war&rsquo;. Do you think that the title of this story is
    appropriate, or would &ldquo;Civil War&rdquo; have been a better title? Explain.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; The title of Chinua Achebe's short story &ldquo;Civil Peace&rdquo; is especially interesting
because it is used in an ironic sense. Achebe uses the title in an ironical way to highlight the
violence which is still present in a post-war Nigeria. Though the war has come to an end, the area is
still chaotic and filled with disagreement. The war leaves a tremendous amount of destruction. Even, a
group of thieves use the term &ldquo;Civil Peace&rdquo; when they rob Iwegbu and his family. Moreover,
the violence that was common during the war is not gone, and things are not much better for common
people like Jonathan Iwegbu.
<br>
<br>
The story follows Jonathan Iwegbu who collects the fragments of his life after the end of the Nigerian
Civil War. It praises the power of positive thinking through Jonathan's success. This shows that people
are hopeful for bright future after the end of the civil war. The writer thus gives more emphasis on
civil peace than civil war.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3> 
<br>
<span>a. How would you describe the civil peace in Nigeria?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The condition of the Civil please in Nigeria wasn't good. After the war, the time of the civil
peace was the time of the resettlement. There was nothing new for the people. People had to face various
problems during that time. The government's law during that time was good. There were many risks in
people's life. Thieves Used to Loot and Beat people without having any fear of law. Though the Civil
piece prevailed there, there was Anarchy everywhere.
<br>
<br>
<span>
    b. What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that
    of Jonathan&rsquo;s?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; If my situation was similar to that of Jonathan's, I would have similar optimism about my life
and my family. I would try to do hard labour keeping faith in God for the welfare of my relatives. I
would try to be quite away from violence.
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.</span>
<br>
&#10140; Jonathan is quite an optimistic person who has been faith in God. He always utters a line in
the name of god saying that &ldquo;Nothing puzzles God&quot;. He becomes quite delighted to find
miracles in his life. He never lives in disparity. He is a hardworking person who thinks positively for
everyone. He loves his family members much. At the time of hardship, he tries to save his family first.
During the time of civil peace, he works so hard to restore his life and his family. His wife and his
kids also work so hard to support him. He really enjoys his present, giving value to his relative as
well as his belongings. He never regrets his loss. He starts the taxi service, repairs his house, and
opens a bar for soldiers to support his family.
<br>
<br>
As an optimistic person, he doesn't regret losing his 20 Pounds which he had got as a favor from the
government.
<br>
<br>
Hence, Jonathan Iwegbu was the protagonist Central character of the story. He was an ex-miner who was
very labourers, and resourceful. He was also the responsible head of the family to inspire his family
with optimism.
