                <br>


                Understanding the text <br>
                <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. According to LaPena, what is the importance of the oral tradition? To what extent do you agree with
                his opinions and why?<br>
                &#10140; According to LaPena, the importance of the oral tradition is to preserve and maintain the
                culture and values of our tradition from generation to generation through oral means. I fully agree with
                his opinions because the culture and tradition should be maintained and preserved from generation to
                generation.<br>
                <br>
                b. Who preserve and pass on the oral tradition?<br>
                &#10140; The elders preserve and pass on the oral tradition. The present generation can maintain the
                oral tradition when they pay attention to knowledge and experience of the elders.<br>
                <br>
                c. What is the danger of not passing on information from generation to generation?<br>
                &#10140; The danger of not passing information from generation to generation is that the culture and
                values of our tradition may extinct. People will have to survive a meaningless life without their
                cultural and traditional values.<br>
                <br>
                d. What is the difference between oral tradition and literary tradition?<br>
                &#10140; An oral tradition is an art form where information related to culture and values are
                transmitted from generation to generation through oral means whereas literary tradition refers to
                written as well as a printed tradition where the information is transmitted through written means.<br>
                <br>
                e. How does LaPena establish a relationship between art and the oral tradition?<br>
                &#10140; He presents the oral tradition as the source of our inspiration for art. He says that the oral
                tradition has an impact on how one visualizes the stories, the characters, the designs and color for
                art, the atmosphere, and other information which can be useful to an artist. Art is an abstract thing
                until it gets ideas from past traditions. He claims that the art gets life because it gathers materials
                from our past tradition and culture.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. If you believe that the
                oral tradition is important, how would you maintain it?<br>
                &#10140; LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. Yes, the oral
                tradition is important, I will maintain it by following it. I will also correct and transfer it to my
                next generation orally. I will make next generation aware about the main danger of losing oral tradition
                if information is not passed on to the next generation. When I grew old, I will teach young people to
                give much attention to it. I will also share its&rsquo; importance. In future, I will publish a book
                about the oral tradition to make it available to all generations.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. &ldquo;Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.&rdquo; Explain this statement
                with reference to the essay.<br>
                &#10140; LaPena states that &ldquo;Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.&rdquo;
                He means that everyone becomes elder but not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders
                by sharing their tradition and culture orally. LaPena makes us aware about the main danger of losing
                oral tradition if information is not passed on to the next generation. He thinks that young people do
                not pay much attention. Later on, many people regret for not listening to what the elders wanted to
                share. It proves that all can&rsquo;t fulfill their duty as elders.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. What is the controlling idea or thesis of this essay?<br>
                &#10140; The essay is about the need to preserve oral tradition by sharing. The writer says it is the
                responsibility of every generation to pass cultural values to the next. And this should be done in an
                authentic way without changing the contents.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. How do topic sentences guide the reader through the essay? What would be lost without them?<br>
                &#10140; Topic sentence is the very first sentence of our paragraph. Topic sentences keep our writing
                focused. It guides and binds the reader through your ideas, logic and argument. Essay has different
                paragraphs but each paragraph focuses on a single idea. Topic sentence states the main idea of the
                paragraph. We lose smooth transition without them. In the same way, reader loses his attention without
                them.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. What are the four major problems developed by LaPena with regard to maintaining the oral tradition.
                How are they used to structure the essay?<br>
                &#10140; The writer describes four main problems in maintaining the oral tradition. First, some elders
                have played ideal and special roles in preserving the values. And it is hard to fill their places.
                Second, the youngsters do not show enough interest in listening to and asking the elders. Third, it is
                hard to maintain traditions in changing times when new technologies destroy old values. The last problem
                is of authentic sharing. Modern research may not collect true data about the oral contents of tradition.
                Once wrong information is published, correction is difficult.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. Write a paragraph or two explaining your attitude toward the oral tradition of passing along
                information.<br>
                &#10140; I believe that oral tradition helps to maintain the cultural values and norms. It is also an
                art form because art takes its subject matters from our tradition. The oral tradition of passing
                tradition from one generation to next is valuable art. I believe that it helps to share and transmit
                ancestors&rsquo; culture, skill and knowledge to next generation. Next generation gets a chance to know
                past culture and tradition. They will understand that our culture is our true identity. So my attitude
                towards the oral tradition is positive. I believe that if we lose our culture, we will lose our identity
                and existence. We will suffer from the problem of identity crisis. Our culture and tradition are a
                living experience. We must preserve, follow and transmit it from one generation to next to save its
                existence. Without it, we will lose our true identity.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Our culture is our identity. Write a few paragraphs explaining how you intend to preserve your
                culture, values and norms.<br>
                &#10140; Yes, it is true that our culture is our identity. If we lose our culture, we will lose our
                identity and existence. We will suffer from the problem of identity crisis. Our culture and tradition
                are a living experience. We must preserve, follow and transmit it from one generation to next to save
                its existence. Without it, human beings will lose their true identity. <br>
                <br>
                Culture plays a crucial role to shape an individual&rsquo;s identity. Moral values, tradition and
                culture help to differentiate human beings and animals. So, it is our true identity. If a person
                doesn&rsquo;t follow his/her culture, he/she will lose identity and value in the society. Our parents
                are real Gods who are transmitting us culture and values to shape our habit and behavior. So, we must
                preserve it by following it. <br>
                <br>
                I will correct wrong things about our culture, values and norms and transmit the right things to my next
                generation. I will make next generation aware about the main danger of losing culture, values and norms
                if information is not passed on to the next generation. When I grew old, I will teach young people to
                give much attention to it. I will also share its&rsquo; importance. In future, I will organize a
                programme for youngsters to teach and guide them about the importance of culture and values. <br>
                <br>
                Culture shapes our behaviour, manner and morals. As a result, it helps to shape their identity. We know
                the fact that our neighbour analyzes us according to our behaviour, manner and moral. It means that we
                are judged in our society by our culture. So, it proves that our culture is our true identity. We should
                not only follow our good culture but also transmit to next generation to preserve its identity.<br>
                <br>
