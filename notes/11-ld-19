    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. It is said that travelling a place equals to reading three books. Do you agree?
        Why?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    I totally agree with the saying that travelling a place equals to reading three books. The world is a great book, of
    which they who never stir from home read only a page. It is a well established fact now that travelling gives a
    character to our knowledge. While travelling we have firsthand knowledge about the place we are travelling. We
    actually see the place with our own eyes, and its memory stays with us throughout our life. For example reading
    about a place may be entertaining and appealing, but visiting it in person will surely be thousand times more
    entertaining and gratifying.
    <br><br>
    Traveling is wonderful in many ways. As we travel we meet more new people, cultures, and lifestyles. With all the
    newness in our life, we are also opened to new insights, outlook, and perception of the world and living, which
    often gives us a new purpose for our lives. While travelling, we have to be prepared for unplanned emergencies and
    schedules. We have to make arrangements for
    our travelling, lodging and boarding. This makes us more organized and self-reliant. Thus, travelling makes the
    inhabitants interconnected. We start feeling ourselves as members of one big family of mankind living on one home
    planet. This makes life more wonderful.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion it can be said that travelling is one of the most precious gifts of life, and we must relish it and
    enjoy its sundry life-transforming benefits.

    <span>
        b. The author spent five-week long walk along the western Himalayas. Do you
        think it was adventurous? Why?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes, it was adventurous because she had covered a distance that totals up to 25 percent of the Nepal Himalaya via
    the lower Great Himalayan Trail, along with some funky detours. She experienced places where few tourists go. She
    chose the Dhaulagiri Circuit. She witnessed and experienced as medieval and raw. She learnt to survive the wild
    western region with primal instincts, human intuition, and oneness with nature. She was able to break the monotony
    of life and work. Life is a mad rush but she became to able to escape it to
    participate in adventure from one place to another, from one activity to another, trying to gather as much as
    possible. Trekking through glaciers, crossing rivers, walking through arid regions, spending cold nights at high
    altitude, walking in the snow being frozen is a challenging task. That’s why this journey is really and adventurous
    one.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>A. Write a travelogue of your recent visit to a natural/religious place in about 300 words.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    With the objective to learn through observation rather than rote learning, we the students of grade-11 visited
    Pashupati area enlisted in the world heritage site. Pashupati area is located on the bank of the holy river Bagmati
    in the eastern part of Kathmandu district. There are places like Gaushala, Pingalastahan, Jay bagesori, Guhesori,
    Deupatan, Gaurighat, etc including the holy Pashupatinath temple in this area. There are about 500 different
    temples, shrines and 1000 shivalingas in this area. The main temple of Pashupatinath has been constructed in Pagoda
    style.
    <br><br>
    The panchamukhi jyotirlinga kept inside Pashupati temple was established by the person called Nep during the Gopal
    dynasty. After the king Prachanda dev, Dharma dutta, Queen of shiva singh; Ganga devi and Prapta malla constructed
    and reconstructed the temple. Evidence is found that even the Shah kings and Rana prime ministers also contributed
    in its reconstructions.
    <br><br>
    Large fair is held on the occasion of Shivaratri Teej, Bala Chaturdashi, Janai Purnima as well as every Monday of
    Shrawan. It is found that thousands of pilgrims visit this temple during these occasions from inside and outside the
    country. The number of pilgrim is not less on other days as well. They visit the Pashupatinath temple as it is
    considered the holiest temple of Hindus.
    <br><br>
    The housings, huts, factories and industries constructed encroaching the land of Pashupati trust should be removed
    from their while afforestation program and construction of religious places should be launched. It is necessary to
    pay special attention in environmental sanitation. The government has to take responsibility in keeping the record
    of the income and expenditure of the temple. Besides, if the sewage can be managed on the bank of Bagmati river the
    importance of this area would increase even more.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>B. Write an essay in about 500 words on 'Importance of Tourism in Nepal'.</span>
    <br><br>
    Nepal is known for being one of the most famous travel destinations in the world. With thousands of tourists visiting the county every year, Tourism in Nepal has soared to new heights. The capital city of the country, Kathmandu and the city of lakes, Pokhara are the top cities in the country to see a sharp increase in the number of tourists in recent years. From UNESCO world heritage sites to different ancient landmarks, from a diverse ethnic community to experiencing different cultures and traditions, all of which have been successful to catch the interest of foreigners to visit the country of Nepal.
    <br><br>
    Tourism heavily influences the working of Nepal's government. Tourism is the number one source to generate foreign currency in Nepal. As the tourism sector grows and more foreigners spend their time in Nepal, the inflow of the currency directly uplifts the working of the country. As Nepal imports more goods than exporting its local products, the foreign currency is the highest number two source to generate money for the country to compete internationally.
    <br><br>
    Foreigners take a keen interest in handicraft goods made from the local products using raw material available in the country. Goods like carpers, status, portraits are at a high demand by travelers. This helps the community to grow. It also expands the popularity of the Nepalese people’s handiwork throughout the world.
    <br><br>
    When foreigners visit the country, they get to experience the local culture and traditions. Historical site visits and observing the art and architecture of famous UNESCO world heritage sites and landmarks help the country to spread its religious norms and values throughout the world. Tourism helps us to spread our influence in the world. Names of sites like Pashupatinath, Boudhanath, Muktinath, Swayambhunath, Lumbini, Kathmandu Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Davis Falls, Phewa Lake, and more have been successfully spread in the world. This has led to an increase in tourist inflow to watch visit these places and its surroundings. This helps to generate easy income for people around the landmarks.
