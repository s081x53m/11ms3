<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>Critical thinking</h3>
<br>
<span>a. What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?</span>
<br>
<br>
In old age, people become physically and psychologically weak. It is true the majority of elderly parents are dissatisfied with their offspring and complain about their lack of understanding. The kids have no idea what their parents really want from them. 
<br><br>
Parents must have certain expectations of their children, and it is our job to understand and meet those expectations. Parents want their children to show them love, affection, and care. They want healthy food, appropriate clothing, a comfy bed, and frequent health check-ups. Aside from that, parents want their children to speak to and listen to them. They are no longer as fast or as powerful as they once were. The children should keep up with them and provide emotional support to those who need it.
<br><br>
The elderly like sharing their life experiences with their offspring in order to help them grow. They offer some great job and life advice for the kids. However, the majority of youngsters seem to overlook their parents' real experiences. They should be allowed to be a part of their lives, and their ideas should be respected. Our elderly parents do not have unrealistically high expectations. They just want to be cared for, appreciated, and be able to spend time with their children.
<br><br>
 
<br>
<br>
<span>b. Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that? Discuss.</span>
<br>
<br>
There are different reasons to live in a distance from parents. It may be for study, job, and business and so on. For achieving their goal, they have to invest more time and efforts. When children live in a distance, they gradually keep away relation from their parents. Finally, it creates a gap or distance between parents and their children. In todays through cut competition, money and success are more important than the parents&rsquo; feelings. They do hard work for earning and saving but not making the parents happy.
<br>
Some children begin a new life with their family far from their parents. Their wife and children become more important than their old-age parents. That is why they have no time to call them and visit their parents.
<br>
This indifference not only degrades the relationship between the parents and their children but also makes the parents live a lonely and miserable life.
<br><br><br>
<span>c. A mother's love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.</span>
<br>
<br>
A mother is the symbol of love, tolerance, patience and forgiveness. No condition is applied to the love of a mother. Any age and status are priceless when they come to about mother's love. The word &lsquo;love&rsquo; is used to describe the emotional feelings of someone with others in many ways. Mothers&rsquo; love is unconditional, everlasting and indispensable.
<br><br>
A child finds his mother as a best friend, mentor, teacher and caretaker. She plays with him along with extra care and nourishment, and is never tired of fulfilling all his demands without thinking of her. Mothers&rsquo; love is about both nourishing her child and teaching her child the moral and cultural values.
<br><br>
Mothers are the emotional foundation of the family. They support and respect everyone&rsquo;s feeling in a family. A member in a family can share almost any secret with his/her mother. This is because mothers have a huge level of faith in their family. Additionally, mothers possess an exceptionally forgiving nature.
