Answer:<br>

 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?<br>
In old age, people become physically and psychologically feeble. True, the majority of elderly parents are dissatisfied with their offspring and complain about their lack of understanding. The kids have no idea what their parents really want from them. <br>
 <br>
Parents must have certain expectations of their children, and it is our job to understand and meet those expectations.<br>
Parents want their children to show them love, affection, and care. They want healthy food, appropriate clothing, a comfy bed, and frequent health check-ups. Aside from that, parents want their children to speak to and listen to them. They are no longer as fast or as powerful as they once were. The children should keep up with them and provide emotional support to those who need it.<br>
 <br>
The elderly like sharing their life experiences with their offspring in order to help them grow. They offer some great job and life advise for the kids. However, the majority of youngsters seem to overlook their parents' real experiences. They should be allowed to be a part of their lives, and their ideas should be respected.<br>
Our elderly parents do not have unrealistically high expectations. They just want to be cared for, appreciated, and be able to spend time with their children.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that? Discuss.<br>
Adult children leave their families and homes for a variety of reasons. Some do so to continue their studies, while others do so to look a work or start a business. They devote all of their time and effort to accomplishing their objective. They believe that success does not come quickly, but rather requires time. Finally, a chasm or separation has developed between parents and their children.<br>
 <br>
Money and achievement are more significant to adult children than their parents' emotions. They labour hard to maintain their social status and reputation, but not to please their parents. They are completely immersed in the materialistic world. Children find visiting parents, spending time with them, and hearing to their real-life experiences to be a revolting notion. Some of the adults establish a new life away from home with their families. More than their ageing parents, their wife and children become a priority. They consider the globe to be their new home. As a result, they have little time to visit, write, or contact their parents.<br>
 <br>
This apathy not only deteriorates the connection between parents and their children, but it also makes the parents lonely and unhappy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
c. A mother's love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.<br>
 <br>
Love, tolerance, patience, and forgiveness are all symbols of a mother. No conditions are placed on a mother's love. When it comes to a mother's love, any age or position is priceless. The term &quot;love&quot; is used to express a person's emotional emotions for others in a variety of ways. The love of a mother is unconditional, eternal, and unbreakable.<br>
 <br>
A child's mother becomes his closest friend, mentor, teacher, and caregiver. She takes additional care and nutrition of him while playing with him, and she never gets weary of meeting all of his requests without thinking about her. Mothers' love include both feeding and instilling moral and cultural values in their children.<br>
 <br>
Mothers are the family's emotional backbone. In a family, they support and respect everyone's feelings. A family member can tell his or her mother virtually anything. This is because moms place a great deal of trust in their children. Mothers are also known for being extremely forgiving.<br>
 <br>
The love a mother has for her kid is undeniable.<br>
 <br>
