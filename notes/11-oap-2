                <br>


                Understanding the text <br>
                <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. What makes Dona Laura think that Don Gonzalo is an ill-natured man? Why do neither Dona Laura nor Don
                Gonzalo reveal their true identities?<br>
                &#10140; Gonzalo scares away the birds who are feeding on her bread crumbs. He makes immoral comments on
                the priests. He talks to Laura very rudely. This unfriendly behavior makes Laura think he is an ill-
                natured man.<br>
                Laura and Gonzalo can&rsquo;t regain their youthful romance now. They think that it is disrespectful to
                share the fact and denounce their true love. Furthermore, they fear of losing the pleasant interaction
                after the revelation of the truth. So, they don&rsquo;t reveal their true identities.<br>
                <br>
                b. At what point of time, do you think, Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognise each other?<br>
                &#10140; Gonzalo says that he is from Valencia and Laura reveals that she lived in a villa at Maricela
                near Valencia. At this point, they begin to recognize each other.<br>
                <br>
                c. When does Dona Laura realise that Don Gonzalo was her former lover?<br>
                &#10140; After they share their memory of the hometown, Gonzalo tells her about the Silver Maiden and
                describes her beauty. At this time, Dona Laura realizes that Don Gonzalo is her former lover.<br>
                <br>
                d. Why do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo spin fictitious stories about themselves?<br>
                &#10140; They spin fictitious stories about themselves because they think that it&rsquo;s not good to
                disclose the identities at old age, and they want to spend their remaining life with sweet memories.<br>
                <br>
                e. How do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo feel about each other?<br>
                &#10140; During their conversation, they find that they were lovers once in their youthful days. But
                they are not ready to disclose their identity. They have no hatred and are ready to depart. They promise
                to meet the next day. Laura sees Gonzalo picking up the violet dropped by her. Both of them bid
                farewell.&#96;<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. Look at the extract below and answer the questions that follow:<br>
                <br>
                &ldquo;Yes, you are only twenty. (She sits down on the bench.) Oh, I feel more tired today than usual.
                (Noticing Petra, who seems impatient.) Go, if you wish to chat with your guard.&rdquo;<br>
                <br>
                i. Who is the speaker?<br>
                &#10140; Dona Laura is the speaker.<br>
                <br>
                ii. Who does &lsquo;you&rsquo; refer to?<br>
                &#10140; 'You' refers to Dona Laura's maid Petra.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Who is the &lsquo;guard&rsquo; the speaker is talking to?<br>
                &#10140; The 'guard' is the 'park's guard' the speaker is talking to.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Read the extract dialogue from the play and answer the questions that follow:<br>
                DONA LAURA: (Indignantly.) Look out!<br>
                DON GONZALO: Are you speaking to me, senora?<br>
                DONA LAURA: Yes, to you.<br>
                DON GONZALO: What do you wish?<br>
                DONA LAURA: You have scared away the birds who were feeding on my crumbs.<br>
                DON GONZALO: What do I care about the birds?<br>
                DONA LAURA: But I do.<br>
                DON GONZALO: This is a public park.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. Who is Dona addressing by saying &ldquo;Look out&rdquo;?<br>
                &#10140; Dona is addressing Don Gonzalo by saying &quot;Look out&quot;<br>
                <br>
                d. What was Dona doing?<br>
                &#10140; Dona was feeding breadcrumbs to pigeons in the park.<br>
                <br>
                e. Who scared the birds? Are they pet birds?<br>
                &#10140; Don Gonzalo scared the birds. No, they aren't pet birds.<br>
                <br>
                f. Where are the speakers at the time of the conversation?<br>
                &#10140; The speakers are in a park at the time of conversation.<br>
                <br>
                g. What is the effect of flashback in the play when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo knew that they were the
                lovers in the past?<br>
                &#10140; The flashback helps Laura and Gonzalo to realize that they were lovers in their youth. However,
                they pretend to be true to each other. They narrate false stories to fool each other. They think that
                revealing the fact can make them lose their present happiness. At the end of the play, they depart
                promising each other to meet the next day.<br>
                <br>
                h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony.<br>
                &#10140; Humor is carried in the opening scene of the play. The comic sense of Laura is admirable when
                she remarks on Gonzalo&rsquo;s walking. She says &ldquo;A carriage would not raise more dust than his
                feet.&rdquo; Her utterance creates laughter when she asks Gonzalo if he uses his handkerchief as a shoe
                brush.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                i. How is the title &lsquo;A Sunny Morning&rsquo; justifiable? Discuss.<br>
                &#10140; The title 'A Sunny Morning ' is justifiable. This play is based on a set of a park in Madrid,
                Spain during a sunny morning. The whole play has been presented here in this setting. Here, a sunny
                morning has provided a fine meeting between two former lovers at their old age. They argue, know each
                other, hide their identities, admire, relate fake stories of their deaths, prefer to meet again in the
                next sunny morning etc. From beginning to the end, the whole play keeps on giving us extreme laughter
                remaining within this setting of a sunny morning. Thus, this title 'A Sunny Morning' is quite
                appropriate that has presented a reconciliation of former lovers at a park with extreme humour.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo? Discuss.<br>
                &#10140; I predict that they will be much more excited in the next meeting. They will talk and share
                their feelings through fake means this time too. Both of them will try to make each other happy. Don
                Gonzalo will certainly be much frank this time. He will try to show his respect towards her. The readers
                will get a chance to see their shyness. They will surely get much more fun through their pretentious
                acts.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets
                affect future meetings?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, it was wise for Dona Laura and Don to keep their identities secret. At the age of seventy,
                they both realized that they were former lovers who separated due to their ill-fate. But, they did a
                good job of not revealing their real identities. Both of them were quite old with weak physical
                conditions. They were not happy due to their old looks. At this age, the revelation of their reality
                would be vain. They thought it better to hide their identities and pretend to be unfamiliar. They chose
                the best way to enjoy their sweet youthful memories through fake means. Their secrets might affect them
                in their future meetings if they keep on lying in such a way. Secrecy never remains for a long time. In
                their case, there is a high risk of the revelation of secrets due to their old age. if they reveal their
                realities unknowingly, they won't try to meet with each other in their upcoming future.<br>
