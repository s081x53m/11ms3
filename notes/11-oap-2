A sunny Morning<br>
<br>
By Shriram Lamichhane<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
<br>
Introduction<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A Sunny Morning&rdquo; is a one act play by Serafin and Joaquin Alvarez Quintero, brothers and celebrated Spanish playwrights of the early twentieth Century. The story is centred on two old lovers now in their 70s meeting at a park and trying to recall their romantic past. The man is Don Gonzalo and the lady is Dona Laura.<br>
Meeting of Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura / Background / Setting<br>
The Autumn season in the background presents the baldness of life coinciding with the entry of two key characters in the play Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura who have also lost their prime youth and attraction. They meet at the park but they are not able to identify each other at the beginning. Don Gonzalo angers Dona Laura as he scares away the birds she was feeding. Laura picks up verbal combat attacking him with a barrage of words. He retorts though, gives up soon and offers her a pinch of snuff and reconciles with her.<br>
<br>
Flashback / The past<br>
<br>
When Don Gonzalo reads from Campoamor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Twenty years pass. He returns&rsquo;, both feel that they were lovers in the past. But they choose to pretend to hide their identities. Don Gonzalo tells Laura that he was Gonzalo&rsquo;s cousin and she says that she heard about Dona Laura&rsquo;s story through her friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
Their Love story - Dona Laura&rsquo;s version<br>
<br>
Laura Llorente lived at Maricela in Valencia. She was known as &lsquo;The Silver Maiden&rsquo; in her locality. Gonzalo would pass by on horseback every morning down the rose path under her window and would toss up to her balcony a bouquet of flowers. Later in the afternoon he would return by the same path and catch the bouquet of flowers she would toss him. Laura&rsquo;s parents wanted to get her married to a merchant. A duel followed and the merchant was badly wounded by Gonzalo. He fled away fearing the consequences. Laura waited for days and months and not hearing from him for long she left her home one afternoon and went to the beach. While she was engrossed in his thoughts she was washed away by the waves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Don Gonzalo&rsquo;s version<br>
<br>
Gonzalo loved her intensely too. After injuring the merchant seriously, fearing the consequences, he took refuge in Seville and Madrid. He wrote many letters to her but they were intercepted by her parents. As there was no reply, in despair, he joined the army and met his death in Africa.<br>
<br>
Conclusion / Reality<br>
<br>
Two years later Laura married someone and settled down in her life. Similarly, Gonzalo, disappointed over his lost love, three months later married a ballet dancer and settled down in Paris. Though they were separated, in their hearts their yearning for romantic love continued. When they met in the park after nearly 50 years, both of them were able to recall their intense romantic affair. Although they came to know about each other in reality, they did not want to reveal, for they had lost their charming youth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the text<br>
<br>
Answer the following Questions<br>
<br>
a. What makes Dona Laura think that Don Gonzalo is an ill-natured man? Why do neither Dona Laura nor Don Gonzalo reveal their true identities? <br>
Ans: Gonzalo disturbs the birds that eat on her crumbs. He makes priests' indecent remarks. He speaks extremely harshly to Laura. This hostile conduct makes Laura believe he's an unfriendly guy.<br>
Laura and Gonzalo can't recover their young romance. They believe sharing the truth is rude, denouncing their real love. They also dread losing the good connection after revealing the truth. They don't disclose their real identity.<br>
<br>
b. At what point of time, do you think Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognise each other?<br>
Ans. Gonzalo claims he's from Valencia, and Laura confesses she resided at Maricela's home near Valencia. They start recognising each other at this stage.<br>
<br>
c. When does Dona Laura realise that Don Gonzalo was her former lover? <br>
Ans. After sharing their hometown memories, Gonzalo tells her about the Silver Maiden, describing her beauty. Dona Laura now believes Don Gonzalo is her previous boyfriend.<br>
<br>
d. Why do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo spin fictitious stories about themselves? <br>
Ans. They create fictional stories about themselves since they believe it's not acceptable to reveal old age identities and want to spend their remaining life with pleasant recollections.<br>
<br>
e. How do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo feel about each other? <br>
Ans. During their discussion, they discover they were once lovers. But they can't reveal their identities. They have no hate and are ready to go. They promise the following day. Laura watches Gonzalo picking up her violet. Both say goodbye.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference to the Context <br>
a. Look at the extract below and answer the questions that follow: <br>
i. Who is the speaker?<br>
Ans : Dona Laura is the speaker.<br>
ii. Who does &lsquo;you&rsquo; refer to?<br>
Ans : 'You' refers to Dona Laura's maid Petra.<br>
iii. Who is the &lsquo;guard&rsquo; the speaker is talking to?<br>
Ans : The 'guard' is the 'park's guard' the speaker is talking to.<br>
<br>
c. Who is Dona addressing by saying &ldquo;Look out&rdquo;? <br>
Ans : By saying &quot;Look out&quot;, Dona is addressing Don Gonzalo.<br>
<br>
d. What was Dona doing? <br>
Ans : Dona was in the park feeding breadcrumbs to pigeons.<br>
<br>
e. Who scared the birds? Are they pet birds? <br>
Ans : Don Gonzalo scared the birds. They are not pet birds.<br>
<br>
f. Where are the speakers at the time of the conversation? <br>
Ans : The speakers are in a park at the time of the conversation, <br>
<br>
g. What is the effect of flashback in the play when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo knew that they were lovers in the past?<br>
Ans: The memory helps Laura and Gonzalo understand they're young loves. They pretend to be true, though. They tell fake stories to deceive each other. They believe that exposing the truth may jeopardise their current pleasure. At the conclusion of the performance, they leave agreeing to meet the following day.<br>
<br>
<br>
h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony. <br>
Ans: The play's first scene has humour. Laura's comedic sense is excellent when she notices Gonzalo's walking. She replies, &quot;A waggon wouldn't produce more dust than its feet.&quot; Her speech generates hilarity when she asks Gonzalo to use his handkerchief as a brush.<br>
<br>
The location and chronology of occurrences referenced and their connection strongly indicate that Gonzalo and Laura were previously lovers. It's ironic they don't want to disclose their identities because they're afraid their altered appearances may be restrained in their newly found bliss.<br>
<br>
<br>
i. How is the title &lsquo;A Sunny Morning&rsquo; justifiable? Discuss. <br>
Ans: They loved each other, but circumstances separated them. They used to be energetic, passionate, and vivacious in the bright morning environment. Now, they're inactive. The beautiful recollection of their young days makes them forget their age, thinking it's a bright morning. The term 'A Sunny Morning' is acceptable for play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference beyond the text<br>
<br>
a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo? Discuss.<br>
Ans : I think the next gathering will be considerably more exciting. They'll express their feelings again via fake methods. Both will strive to make each other happy. Don Gonzalo will be more frank this time. He'll make an attempt to express her gratitude. Readers will notice their timidity. With their pompous acts, they'll have a lot more fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?<br>
Ans. Dona Laura and Don were smart to hide their identities. They both learned at the age of seventy that they were previous lovers divided owing to their tragedy. However, they did an excellent job hiding their real identities. They were elderly and in terrible physical shape. Their previous looks displeased them. At this age, revealing their real character would be useless. <br>
<br>
They reasoned it would be better to hide their identities and appear to be strangers. They planned to recreate their lovely childhood experiences via deceit. If they continue to deceive this way, their secrets may affect future encounters. Secrecy is seldom maintained for long periods. Because of their advanced age, they risk exposing secrets. If they unintentionally disclose their truths, they won't try to meet in the near future.<br>
