                g. What is the main message of this speech?<br>

                terrorism. This is the main message of this speech.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking<br><br>
                a. &lsquo;All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child?
                Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend
                school.&rsquo;<br>
                <br>
                &#10140; The nation cannot develop unless childrens are educated. Our constitution guarantees every
                child's right to education, including free education up to secondary level. Many youngsters in our
                nation still lack this basic right. The government and parents should work together to guarantee that
                children attend school, obtain a decent education, and acquire skills for the 21st century.<br>
                Quality learning needs a safe, pleasant atmosphere and trained and motivated instructors. However, most
                rural schools lack enough physical facilities, teaching and non-teaching personnel, and financial
                resources. The government should enable school leaders and instructors to take professional
                responsibility, establish standards, and fully support them in providing excellent learning
                opportunities for students. Parents must provide their children's fundamental requirements.<br>
                They don't send their kids to school and blame it on poverty, even though education is free. Instead,
                they are willing to waste their money. They can offer basic learning resources and a fun learning
                environment at home. Everyday learning should be promoted for the kids. Parents are expected to
                participate in school activities as well as at home.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b.&rsquo;Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of
                providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination
                against girls?&rsquo;<br><br>
                &#10140; In our country, schooling still discriminates between sons and girls. In rural Nepal, gender is
                the greatest predictor of school attendance. Girls are less likely than males to complete high school
                because their parents see their training for adult marital responsibilities differently. After marriage,
                girls are expected to leave their family. Our cultural norms demand females to perform more household
                labour than guys. Boys' education is given precedence since females have less time to conduct schoolwork
                due to domestic duties. Girls drop out of school due to child marriage and poverty. So young females
                don't obtain formal schooling.<br>
                Diverse methods may be used to combat prejudice. Homework for females should be reduced. Girls should
                have special privileges in the library, canteen, and playground. Prioritize secondary education for
                girls. Schools should be more girl-friendly and closer to families. The government should create public
                awareness raising organisations for girls' education. Teachers must be gender conscious.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. &lsquo;A Chinese philosopher Confucius said, &ldquo;If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your
                plan is for ten years, plant trees; if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.&rdquo; What
                is the meaning of this saying? Elaborate this with examples.&rsquo;<br><br>
                &#10140; The only meaning here is that our objectives determine our behaviour. Short term objectives
                need short term efforts. Long range objectives take longer to achieve, but they are different. If we
                know where we want to go and how long it will take us to get there, we can plan our route, our
                conveyance, and our companions.<br>
                The declaration also stresses the value of education for societal growth. Education is vital in
                developing skills, values, and awareness. It moulds a person. Long-term, education brings higher
                benefits. Tomorrow's civilised and moral society will be educated youngsters today. The greatest
                possible education for children is an investment in the future of the whole society.<br>
