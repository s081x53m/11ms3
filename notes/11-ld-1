                <br>
                Summary<br>
                <br>
                The story starts with the children playing in the garden of the Giant every afternoon after coming from
                school. The
                garden was lovely, large, with soft grass, and fruit trees. The trees bore rich fruits and birds sang
                sweetly sitting on
                them.<br>
                <br>
                One day after seven years the giant came back. He was staying with his friend, the Cornish Ogre. The
                children were
                scared to see him. He saw the children playing and said that he would not allow anyone to play here as
                it was his own
                garden. He built a wall around it and also put a notice board. The notice board displayed a warning on
                it,
                &lsquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rsquo;.<br>
                <br>
                The children became sad as they had no other place to play. They would wander around the high walls of
                the garden and
                remember the beautiful garden inside them.<br>
                <br>
                The spring season came and there were blossoms and little birds all around. But it was winter in the
                giant&rsquo;s
                garden and there were frost and snow. In the absence of children birds also did not sing. Once a flower
                bloomed out of
                the grass but after seeing the notice board, it also went back to sleep. Then came the North Wind and
                the hailstorm. Due
                to the giant&rsquo;s selfishness, autumn&rsquo;s golden fruits also did not come to his garden.<br>
                <br>
                Then one morning, the giant heard sweet and lovely music. It was a linnet singing outside his window.
                The hail and the
                North Wind stopped and he could feel the spring. He saw that the children came into his garden through a
                little hole.
                The children were sitting on the branches of trees and the trees were blossoming. He also saw the birds
                flying and hear
                them chirping. The flowers had also come up.<br>
                <br>
                But, to his surprise, in one corner there was still winter. He saw that there a young boy was standing
                and he was not
                able to reach the branches of trees. The tree lowered its branches but still, he could not climb.<br>
                <br>
                At this scene, his heart melted. He realized that he was really very selfish. He decided to put that boy
                on the top of
                the tree, pull down the walls, and allow children to play here forever. But when the children saw him,
                they ran away and
                the garden became winter again. However, that little boy did not run as he was weeping. The giant put
                him on the top of
                the tree and the tree blossomed at once. He kissed the giant.<br>
                <br>
                The other children realizing that the giant is not wicked came back. The spring came back with them. The
                giant used to
                play with the children ever afternoon but that little boy was nowhere to be seen. As the years went by,
                he grew very
                weak. One winter morning, he saw a lovely tree with white blossoms in a corner. The branches of the tree
                were golden and
                the little boy stood under it.<br>
                <br>
                The boy was wounded which made the giant very angry. He told the boy that he will slay the man who has
                harmed him. The
                boy told him that these were the wounds of love. The boy smiled and asked the giant to come to his
                garden. Later, the
                children found the giant dead under the tree covered with white blossoms<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Understanding the text<br>
                <br>
                a. Where did the children use to play?<br>
                &#10140; They used to play in the Giant's garden.<br>
                <br>
                b. What did the Snow and the Frost do to the garden?<br>
                &#10140; The snow covered the grass with its large white coat and Frost painted all the silver trees.
                Afterwards, they
                invited North Wind to stay with them.<br>
                <br>
                c. What did the giant hear when he was lying awake in bed?<br>
                &#10140; The giant heard beautiful music.<br>
                <br>
                d. Why do you think spring season never came to the giant's garden?<br>
                &#10140; I think the spring season never came to the giant's garden because he didn't let the kids play
                there.<br>
                <br>
                e. How did the giant realise his mistake?<br>
                &#10140; He saw his mistake as the children stopped visiting the garden and the garden never faced the
                spring
                season.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Reference to the context<br>
                <br>
                A. Read the extracts given below and Ans the questions that follow.<br><br>
                a. &ldquo;How happy we were there!&rdquo; they said to each other.<br>
                <br>
                i. Where does &lsquo;there&rsquo; refer to?<br>
                &#10140; 'There' refers to the giant's garden where children used to play after school.<br>
                <br>
                ii. What does &lsquo;they&rsquo; refer to?<br>
                &#10140; 'They' refers to the children who used to come and play in Giant's garden after school.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Why are they saying so?<br>
                &#10140; They are saying so because they aren't allowed to play in the giant's garden anymore. The giant
                has chased them
                out of his garden, furious.<br>
                <br><br>
                b. &ldquo;I have many beautiful flowers,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the children are the most beautiful
                flowers of
                all.&rdquo;<br>
                <br>
                i. Who is the speaker?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker is an old and feeble giant who keeps on watching the children at their play sitting
                on his
                armchair.<br>
                <br>
                ii. Who is he speaking to?<br>
                &#10140; He is speaking to himself admiring his garden.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Who are &lsquo;the children&rsquo; that the speaker is referring to?<br>
                &#10140; 'The Children' that the speaker is referring to are the small and innocent school children who
                enjoy a lot in
                the giant's garden.<br>
                <br>
                iv. Why is the speaker saying that &lsquo;the children are the &#8230;&#8230;&rsquo; ?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker says 'children are the most........' because like the flowers, children also bring
                joy and
                happiness in the garden.<br>
                <br><br>
                c. When the little child smiled at the Giant, and said to him, &quot;You let me play once in your
                garden, today you
                shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise,&quot; shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. What
                is the
                coincidence of this event? Describe it in relation to this fairy story.<br>
                &#10140; When the Giant was very old and weak, he couldn&rsquo;t play with the children any more. He sat
                in his armchair
                and watched the children playing. One winter morning, the little child whom he once helped to climb the
                tree appeared
                and offered him never ending and peaceful life in his garden i.e. heaven. At the same time, the Giant
                died. Thus, the
                occurrence of the child&rsquo;s offer of eternal life in heaven and the death of the Giant is the
                coincidence. However,
                from the religious point of view, reappearance of the child, with prints of nails on the palms of the
                hands and feet,
                and the biological death of the Giant have a close association.<br>
                <br><br>
                B. The story makes use of personification as one of the main figures of speech. Cite three examples of
                personification
                from the story. What is the significance of the seasons personified in the story?<br>
                &#10140; The story &lsquo;The Selfish Giant&rsquo; makes the use of personification as one of the main
                figures of speech
                which gives human qualities to the non-human objects. In the story, the technique of personification has
                made non- human
                entities more vivid or helped the readers understand and sympathize with or react emotionally to them.
                The effect of
                this is to make flowers, seasons, frost, snow, wind, hail and one of the trees, reinforce the story
                writer&rsquo;s moral
                vision.<br>
                <br>
                The flowers are personified when one of them begins to bloom, then sees there are no children in the
                garden, and goes
                back to sleep. This variety of personification continues with the happiness of snow and frost as the
                garden lacks the
                spring season and they invite the north wind to the garden. The wind is personified when it says with
                delight that they
                must ask the hail to visit the garden.<br>
                <br>
                The story has the significance of the seasons personified. At the beginning of the story, the seasons
                bless the garden
                with pleasant weather until the Giant sends the children away from his garden. Repulsed by the Giant's
                unkindness the
                spring season leaves the garden. The seasons' disfavor indicates that the Giant's selfishness goes
                against the natural
                order and thus deserves punishment.<br>
                <br><br>
                C. This story can be read as a fairy story, where the children, the seasons, the tree, the corner of the
                garden, the
                snow, the wind and the frost are all used as symbolism. Interpret those symbols.<br>
                &#10140; The story &lsquo;The Selfish Giant&rsquo; is a fairy tale. The story writer has adopted the
                approach of
                symbolism to teach the readers a moral lesson. The children symbolize innocence and love. Likewise,
                seasons represent
                hope, life and death. The tree is the symbol of patience whereas the corner of the garden stands for
                heaven. The snow,
                the wind, and the frost signify grief, sorrow and discomfort.<br>
                <br><br>
                D. Which figure of speech is used for &lsquo;winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little
                child&rsquo;? Who is the
                little child compared to?<br>
                &#10140; As a fairy tale, the story is full of figures of speech. Both the methods of personification
                and symbolism are
                used for winter, frost, snow, north wind and hail. The little child is presented as the Christian
                symbol. He is compared
                to Jesus Christ.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Reference beyond text<br>
                <br>
                a. What is the main theme of the story?<br>
                &#10140; Oscar Wilde has covered the themes of unselfishness and love. At the beginning of the story the
                giant is very
                selfish and cold towards the children, and builds a high wall around the garden and puts a
                notice&ndash;board to stop
                them. But later he realizes his mistake when the children stop coming to the garden and the garden never
                experiences the
                spring season until he allows them to play in his garden. As he knows the meaning of love and sharing,
                the spring
                weather comes. Not only the Giant brings happiness to the children but he also ensures that he will get
                into Heaven with
                his act of kindness. The Giant&rsquo;s nature is associated with that of human beings. We rarely share
                our belongings to
                any one even if someone is needed. We are selfish too. The story teaches us to share love to get love in
                return.<br>
                <br><br>
                b. Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?<br>
                &#10140;Yes, God punishes those who are cruel to childs and very selfish. As we saw in this story, Giant
                has really been
                so cruel to the childs and selfish because of which Spring never came in his garden. Snow and frost
                always remained in
                his garden, which symbolizes that negative atmosphere surrounding his garden when there were not any
                children. Therefore
                god punishes to those who are cruel to children and very selfish.<br>
