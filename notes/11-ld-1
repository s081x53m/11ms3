    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. &lsquo;All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child?
        Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend
        school.&rsquo;
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Nepal has put in place a strict legal arrangement to eradicate illiteracy. The 2018 act strictly instructs
    parents to enroll their students in schools. Education is the right of life. It is the most indispensable part of
    human life, especially in the life of children. Children all over the world deserve quality education which is
    expected to bring about complete dimensional transformation in their later life. In this regard, we should ensure
    this educational right to every child throughout the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    We come to hear the proverb â€œmorning shows the day in the market place when people are invoice in the social and
    academic discourse. This should be well applied in the context of children provided that the children get the
    opportunity of quality education so that they could be morally and professionally dressed in later life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        b.&rsquo;Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of
        providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination
        against girls?&rsquo;
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Our country since antiquity has been ruled over by the traditional gender roles which are constructed out
    of prejudices and male domination. No space or very limited space is provided to the girls and women. This happens
    in the sector of education opportunities are provided to the sons and the boys but the daughters and the girls are
    deprived of their invaluable opportunities.
    <br>
    <br>
    Several strategies should be applied by all to afford education to the girls to bring about the prosperity of the
    nation. Some of them are listed below:
    <br><br>
    1. Gender biases should be ended.
    <br><br>
    2. Traditional gender roles constructed out of male hegemony should be corrected.
    <br><br>
    3. The internalized potentialities of the daughters should be acknowledged.
    <br><br>
    4. The preference for the son should be removed from the peopleâ€™s psychology.
    <br><br>
    5. The money given in the name of dowry should be invested in the girl's education.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        c. &lsquo;A Chinese philosopher Confucius said, &ldquo;If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your
        plan is for ten years, plant trees; if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.&rdquo; What
        is the meaning of this saying? Elaborate this with examples.&rsquo;
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; The meaning of this saying is that our objectives determine our behaviour. If we have short term objectives then we need short term efforts whereas long range objectives take longer to achieve. If we know where we want to go and how long it will take us to get there, what we have to do to achieve, we can easily carve our path.
    <br>

    The declaration also stresses the value of education for societal growth. Education is vital in developing skills, values, and awareness. It moulds a person. Long-term, education brings higher benefits. Tomorrow's civilised and moral society will be educated youngsters today. The greatest possible education for children is an investment in the future of the whole society.
