    device for education. All the information one requires is just a click away. Students can educate themselves on
    various topics using social media.
<br><br>
Furthermore, as more and more people are distancing themselves from newspapers, they are depending on social media
for news. You are always updated on the latest happenings of the world through it. A person becomes more socially
aware of the issues of the world.
<br><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    The difference between face to face communication and virtual communication is that in the face to face communication, you can feel and see the presence of the other party, whereas, in virtual communication, you cannot see the other party to whom you are communicating with.
    <br>
    <br>
    Face to face communication is a traditional method of communication that allows you of being able to see the opposite party you are talking to. This allows betterment in exchange for communication and information both for a person and to whom he is communicating. Even though the technology today is remarkable many still follow this kind of communication for clarity. Face to face communication is also an informal type of discussion between friends, family, colleagues, etc.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>b. What is cyber bullying? What are its effects? How can it be stopped?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an
    intimidating or threatening nature is known as cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is a common occurrence in
    which children, teenagers, and even adults are targeted, humiliated, tortured, or threatened online.
    Rumors, threats, posting sexual comments, sharing the victim's personal information, and hate speech are
    all examples of harmful bullying behavior. Bullying is commonly found on social networking sites, SMS,
    email, and online gaming.
    <br>
    <br>
    Cyberbullying is a multi-faced issue. Victims of cyberbullying feel unsafe even when they are at home.
    It is extremely difficult to avoid. It causes mental, emotional, and physical harm to the person because
    its effects can last for a long time. Low self-esteem, even suicidal tendencies, and a variety of

    Cyberbullying prevention is the need of the hour. It needs to be monitored and put an end to. There are
    various ways to tackle cyberbullying. Awareness is the key to prevent online harassment. We should make
    the children aware from an early age so they are always cautious. Moreover, parents must monitor their
