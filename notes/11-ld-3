                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking<br>
                a. Does social media have positive impact in the society? Discuss.<br>
                &#10140; In today's era, social media has create a positive impact in the society. Platforms such as
                Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it possible for us to stay in touch with family, friends, and
                relatives who live in different parts of the world. People can use these social networking sites to
                share photos and videos, as well as communicate with their friends and family. This strengthens our
                bonds and brings families closer together in ways that were previously impossible.<br>
                <br>
                Professional websites and official organization web pages provide numerous opportunities to learn new
                facts, explore the world, and read the most recent survey results, reports, and other information. There
                has been a significant increase in online learning, and a strong profession has grown up around it. It's
                worth noting that people who work in businesses can also benefit from social media. Online promotions
                are less expensive than running ads on TV and in newspapers on a regular basis. They do, however,
                provide an opportunity to reach a larger audience and find active customers all over the world.
                Businesspeople can understand the state of the market and adopt new strategies to meet the tastes and
                demands of customers by interacting with them and receiving feedback from them. E-commerce and digital
                marketing are popular nowadays.<br>
                <br>
                Social media allows the users to share their thoughts and views, create their own content and receive
                the latest information and news. Also, finding a job and hiring the employees required, using social
                networking are in easy reach. In fact everything looks easier to do with social media.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. How do you compare virtual communication and face-to-face communication?<br>
                &#10140; The communication process consists of a sender, message and a recipient. Communication process
                will be completed when the recipient comprehends the sender&rsquo;s message. To make conversations more
                comfortable and convenient people use either of the methods: virtual and face-to-face.<br>
                <br>
                Virtual communication does not necessitate the presence of the recipient. It allows us to communicate
                with people regardless of their location. Nonverbal communication is more likely. We can keep in touch
                with people via virtual communication even if they are busy and unable to meet in person. Virtual
                communication is commonly conducted through a variety of social networking sites and apps. When we
                communicate virtually, it's easier to organize and share all of the information we need.<br>
                <br>
                Face-to-face communication necessitates the presence of both the sender and the recipient, as well as a
                prompt response. We can actively notice someone's level of attention in our conversation when we talk to
                them face to face. It allows us to socialize and form personal relationships. It keeps our communication
                skills from rusting. We can express what we want to say very precisely with our body language and tone.
                Because both verbal and nonverbal communication methods are used in face-to-face communication, the
                message can be easily understood by the parties involved. It is preferable for illiterate people because
                they cannot comprehend written messages. Conversations on the phone or on a cell phone, as well as
                chatting on the internet, are examples of oral communication, but they are not the same as face-to-face
                communication.<br>

                b. What is cyber bullying? What are its effects? How can it be stopped?<br>
                &#10140; The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an
                intimidating or threatening nature is known as cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is a common occurrence in
                which children, teenagers, and even adults are targeted, humiliated, tortured, or threatened online.
                Rumors, threats, posting sexual comments, sharing the victim's personal information, and hate speech are
                all examples of harmful bullying behavior. Bullying is commonly found on social networking sites, SMS,
                email, and online gaming.<br>
                <br>
                Cyberbullying is a multi-faced issue. Victims of cyberbullying feel unsafe even when they are at home.
                It is extremely difficult to avoid. It causes mental, emotional, and physical harm to the person because
                its effects can last for a long time. Low self-esteem, even suicidal tendencies, and a variety of
                negative emotional reactions may be experienced by the victim.<br>
                <br>
                Cyberbullying prevention is the need of the hour. It needs to be monitored and put an end to. There are
                various ways to tackle cyberbullying. Awareness is the key to prevent online harassment. We should make
                the children aware from an early age so they are always cautious. Moreover, parents must monitor their
                children&rsquo;s online activities and limit their usage. Most importantly, cyberbullying must be
                reported instantly without delay. This can prevent further incidents from taking place.<br>
