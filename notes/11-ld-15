    <br><br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?</span>
    <br><br>
    A warmonger is someone who instigates war, or advocates war over peaceful solutions. Yes, warmongers are the
    greatest enemies for peace because they are constantly promoting war. They are very agile and uproarious. They
    generally need to attack or assault another country.
    Their main principle is "War is Peace" which means that in order to have peace one must tolerate the horrors of war.
    They are just against the concept of peace and humanity. Due to
    warmongers, the world has faced numerous losses up to now.
    <br><br>
    I want to suggest them to spread love and peace among humans so that humans can have peaceful and harmonious lives. 
    The pains which you have provided to numerous people, the same pains will be experienced by you too. Bad deeds are always punished. The pains and suffering of injured people, the cries of victims, the curses of humanity will never allow you to survive peacefully. Try to stop all your nonsensical ideas against humanity. 
    <br><br>

    <br>
    <span>b. The Nobel Prize winner American novelist John steinbeck 1920 1968 on said &ldquo;all war is a symptom of
        man&rsquo;s failure as a thinking animal.&rdquo; Do you agree with the novelist? Why?</span>
    <br><br>
    It is absolutely true all war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal. War is the worst thing in the
    world; it gives benefits to none; it causes immense loss of human life and resources to all. Both the winning
    country as well as the losing country incur heavy casualties and losses.
    <br><br>
    Wars can never end conflicts, they complicate them further. World War 1 and World War 2 are the two ugliest scars on
    the face of mankind. They wreaked so much havoc that its precedent is impossible to find since the beginning of
    evolution. Wars are futile and outcome of manâ€™s ignorance and anger. The people of the world must learn a lesson
    from these two holocausts.
    <br><br>

    All the wars that were fought in the history of mankind taught man the horrible lessons of its futility. The most
    heinous and horrible war in the entire history of mankind is the Second World War. The dates August 6, 1945, and
    August 9, 1945 are written indelibly on the pages of history with blood of thousands of people who died a painful
    death in the nuclear bomb attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Hiroshima bomb killed approximately 1,40,000 people
    instantaneously; Nagasaki underwent almost the same nightmare.
    <br><br>

    Seeing the enormity of death and destruction, the entire world condemned the use of nuclear bombs. Even those who
    were in favour of its use in war, felt remorseful. The most frightening aspect related to nuclear bombs is, the
    world is full of them. Bombs many times more potent than the ones used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are lying ready in
    the arsenals of many country. The world is in a precarious position. When will man become wiser? May be soon!
    <br><br>

    In conclusion it can be said that wars are symbolic of savage backwardness. Civilized people resolve their conflicts
    through peaceful dialogue at the discussion table. So, if a war happens, it means human thinking has failed.
    <br><br><br>

    <span>c. Does any war end all wars and bring lasting peace to the world? Discuss.</span>
    <br><br>
    War is a state of conflict between different societies or countries. The general cause of war is the difference in
    opinions. Although in some cases, a war to end wars might help attain the peace that peace comes at a price, which
    is a loss of
    life and property. The World War 1 and 2 have already caused huge irrecoverable damage.
    <br><br>
    War is not the only way to bring peace. There are many alternative ways such as negotiating to terms which are
    reasonable for both the countries and hence resolving the problem. There shall always be a win-win situation. Some
    terms shall be accepted by one party and some by the others.
    <br><br>
    We might be divided by religion, sex, color and the boundaries between our countries but we all belong to the human
    race. One should treat the other like a brother and help each other out. There will be differences for sure, which
    should be sorted out in a peaceful manner.
    <br><br>

    Take a look at our two World Wars. They have proved that wars cause major suffering and in fact, the only reason
    that World War I ended was that most of the countries involved were exhausted and fed up, and begged their leaders
    for a ceasefire to be called. Wars would be endless if it was not for humanity's own limits.
    <br><br>

    In my opinion, war will never be able to bring true, long-lasting peace. Nations will be hit emotionally and
    economically. So saying that any war end all wars is not the way to create peace. War is neither a solution or
    option to bring peace.
    <br><br><br>

    <span>d. Why do you think countries go to war?</span>
    <br><br>
    A war is typically fought by a country or group of countries against an opposing country or group with the aim of
    achieving an objective through the use of force. There is rarely one single, clear cause of conflict and,
    ultimately, war. The causes of a war are usually numerous and can often be intertwined in a complicated way. Some of
    the major causes of war are as follows:
    <br><br>

    <b>1. Economic Gain</b>
    <br>
    Often wars are caused by one country's wish to take control of another country's wealth. Whatever the other reasons
    for a war may be, there is almost always an economic motive underlying most conflicts, even if the stated aim of the
    war is presented to the public as something more noble.
    <br><br>

    <b>2. Territorial Gain</b>
    <br>
    A country might decide that it needs more land, either for living space, agricultural use, or other purposes. These
    are conflicts that are fought indirectly between opposing powers in a
    third country. Each power supports the side which best suits their logistical, military, and economic interests.
    <br><br>

    <b>3. Religion</b>
    <br>
    Religious conflicts often have very deep roots. They can lie dormant for decades, only to re-emerge in a flash at a
    later date. Religious wars can often be tied to other reasons for conflict, such as nationalism or revenge for a
    perceived historical slight in the past.
    <br><br>

    <b>4. Nationalism</b>
    <br>
    Nationalism in this context essentially means attempting to prove that your country is superior to another by
    violent subjugation. This often takes the form of an invasion.
    <br><br>

    <b>5. Revenge</b>
    <br>
    Seeking to punish, redress a grievance, or simply strike back for a perceived slight can often be a factor in the
    waging of war. Revenge also relates to nationalism, as the people of a country which has been wronged are motivated
    to fight back by pride and spirit.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Write essays in about 500 words on the following topics.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>a. War and peace</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">War and Peace</p>
    <br>
    There is a typical saying that war is never ever good, peace is never ever bad. However, if we recall right into the
    background of the human race, it will be transparent that there have been war since prehistoric times. Although
    attempts have actually been made to eliminate it, success has not been achieved up until now. Hence, infinite peace
    seems to be beyond our reach.
    <br><br>

    Some people neglect that war always brings damage on a mass scale. They forget Mahatma Gandhi's teaching of
    non-violence, adhering to which he freed his motherland from the shackles of enslavement. They forget that if Gandhi
    might oust the effective Britishers by dint of non-violence, why not others adhere to the exact same footprint.
    <br><br>

    War are essential evils as well as their scaries are a lot of and of such magnitude that they can not be explained
    in words. We have to not neglect the horrors of both world war. In the war, there was mass-killing and destruction
    of building. Thousands were made orphans and widows. War brings disgust and also spreads out fallacy. People become
    ruthless as well as egocentric. As result humanity as well as principles experience.
    <br><br>

    War are not the option to the problems. Instead, they create troubles and produce disgust amongst nations. war can
    decide one problem yet gives birth to way too many. Hiroshima as well as Nagasaki are the best terrible faces of the
    effect of war. Also after 60 years, individuals are dealing with the anguishes of war. Whatever be the reason for
    war, it always causes the damage of life and building at large.
    <br><br>

    On the whole, the war has always been the greatest blot on mankind. It was developed by the man himself today it is
    past the control of all human pressures. Now it calls for retrospection for the entire mankind to study it for the
    sake of mankind, or else, absolutely nothing will remain neither war nor humanity.
    <br><br><br>

    <span>b. Responsive youths for peace and prosperity</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Responsive Youths for Peace and Prosperity</p>
    <br>
    Youth plays vital role in everything, everywhere. Diversity exists everywhere in this world and it should be
    accepted to create a balanced and peaceful society. Thus, for each and every country, youth is very important factor
    in creating a harmony. Youth contributes innovative ideas and they are fresh and young blood who can accomplish
    entire plan with their passion and hard work.
    <br><br>
    Youth must play an active role in creating and promoting peace, tolerance, co-existence, and non-extremist
    environment. They must address all types of conflicts and issues in a constructive way that encourages
    reconciliation and conflict resolution. The youth can be the agent of a change by changing their attitude and
    perspective towards the world. At the national level, the youth can be the community leaders of their respective
    communities and can initiate various projects to educate the people of rural areas. They can join various
    non-government organisations working for peace, tolerance, and harmony. In this way, youth ambassadors of all the
    communities may form link with one another and this will enhance the acceptability and adaptability level among
    them.
    <br><br>
    Youth need to educate the western world about Islam and Muslim world about western world. In this way, rigidity,
    extremism, fanaticism, sectarianism and all such factors, differences and misconceptions hampering the way of peace
    will be removed. At the national level, youth must understand their socio-economic problems and they must know how
    to tackle them peacefully. Likewise, on the international level, our youth must be trained to cope with evils like
    racism, terrorism, prejudice and ethnocentrism. In this way, youth can be responsible for balanced, prosperous and
    peaceful society.
