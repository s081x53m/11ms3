 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
 <br>
a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?<br>
 <br>
Answer: According to the dictionary, a warmonger is described as someone who promotes or advocates violence against other nations or organisations. To put it another way, if there is a conflict, there will be no peace. As a result, we may say in a straightforward manner that warmongers are the opponents of peace.<br>
 <br>
However, not all conflicts are conceived with nefarious motives. Some of the battles that have occurred throughout history have been fought for the restoration of peace and security, as well as the elimination of violence. As a result, accusing war criminals of being the biggest opponents of peace will be illogical. Those whose only goal is to do damage to the general population and create an imbalance are, without a question, an obstacle to the preservation of peace.<br>
 <br>
They should be aware of what they are doing. From my perspective, the only thing they should do is to think about humanity and put an end to conflicts that cost the lives of so many innocent people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. The Nobel Prize winner American novelist John steinbeck 1920 1968 on said &ldquo;all war is a symptom of man&rsquo;s failure as a thinking animal.&rdquo; Do you agree with the novelist? Why?<br>
 <br>
War is a sign of man's failure as a thinking animal. War is the worst thing in the world; it helps no one and destroys everything. Both the winning and losing countries suffer significant loses.<br>
 <br>
Wars never solve problems, they exacerbate them. World War I and II left the world's two most obscene scars. They caused so much devastation that no precedent can be found since the beginning of evolution. Wars are a result of human stupidity and fury. The world must learn from these two holocausts.<br>
 <br>
All conflicts in history have taught man the futility of fighting. The Second World Conflict was the most wicked and terrible war in human history. The dates August 6, 1945, and August 9, 1945, are permanently etched on the pages of history by thousands of individuals who perished in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bomb strikes. The Hiroshima bomb murdered about 140,000 people in an instant; Nagasaki suffered a similar fate.<br>
 <br>
Seeing the devastation, the whole world denounced the deployment of nuclear weapons. Even those who favoured its use in battle felt guilty. The most terrifying feature of nuclear weapons is their abundance. Many countries' arsenals include bombs many times more powerful than those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The planet is in peril. When will man learn? Soon!<br>
 <br>
In conclusion, conflicts represent barbaric backwardness. Civilized individuals settle disputes peacefully at the table. So war implies human thought has failed.<br>
 <br>
c. Does any war end all wars and bring lasting peace to the world? Discuss.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;The war to end all wars&rdquo; was a popular slogan used to characterise WWI*. In any event, the name was a paraphrase of H.G. Wells' famous novel The War That Will End War. In this book, Wells argues that conquering German imperialism is the only way to end the war.<br>
 <br>
The slogan took on and was frequently used by the British to justify war. It was repeated by President Woodrow Wilson, and it became linked with the US entrance into the war. Like how America's participation will &quot;safeguard democracy globally.&quot; Basically, it was a means to justify a horrible war that killed millions of young men - the product of a generation.<br>
 <br>
With retrospect, this argument was at best na&iuml;ve, and at worst blatant propaganda. When the war was initially announced, there was widespread support and enthusiasm. Every country participating felt justified and viewed war as a way to achieve absolutely acceptable goals. The emotions were only regarded as imperialist propaganda and malicious falsehoods after years of stalemate and terrible trench fighting.<br>
 <br>
Truth is somewhere in the centre. Germany entered the war seeking a route out of encirclement and to avoid domestic social reform demands. Austria-Hungary, on the other hand, wanted to punish Serbia for its Balkan woes. Russia wanted to protect its Serbian allies, France wished to revenge the Franco-Prussian loss of 1871, and Britain wished to prevent Germany from dominating Europe.<br>
 <br>
But that's another storey - how did WWI start? I'm sure someone inquired. If not, ask your own query! I had to conduct significant study on the topic in university. I need to use it!<br>
 <br>
As a side note, historians recognised that the two wars were intimately intertwined and renamed World War I. During the conflict, it was dubbed &ldquo;The Great War&rdquo;.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
d. Why do you think countries go to war?<br>
 <br>
Three major factors, in my opinion, drive nations to wage wars.<br>
 <br>
1) Resources. <br>
Many times, natural resources (and other benefits) may be obtained if the invading nation is vanquished. Natural resources such as opium (in Afghanistan), oil, gold, diamonds, and so on....and other kinds of resources such as a financial system that can be established, or a waterway that can be controlled for imports and exports.<br>
 <br>
2) Spirituality. <br>
People's faiths may lead them to do strange things at times. Too many people suffer from the dreadful urge to impose their religious beliefs on others, rather than allowing their ultimate god to do it (if deities even exist).<br>
 <br>
3) There is a lack of communication and comprehension. <br>
Almost every time I see a battle, I am struck by the lack of communication and comprehension of why the other side takes the position it does. It's two sides (or more) that have never truly spoken with each other in a polite way to allow for peaceful settlements, and it's two sides (or more) who have never really taken the time to understand each other. One side only knows that their position is right, and that anybody who believes otherwise is mistaken. Then follows the use of violence to impose such views on the opponent. <br>
 <br>
When an opponent complies and accepts their opponent's point of view, the use of force in the form of violence comes to a stop. The use of violence, on the other hand, spreads to lower-echelon groups of individuals who disagree with the upper-choice echelon's to comply.<br>
