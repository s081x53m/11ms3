    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or
        against this statement.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; In an autocracy, power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual. Fear and control are
    features of the authoritarian political system. Absolute monarchs and military dictators have
    historically served as instances of autocracy. When rapid and definite action is required, autocracy has
    a significant benefit in that important choices can be taken swiftly. Autocratic leaders often make
    decisions based on their own ideas and judgments, and they seldom take input from their followers.
    <br><br>
    The rulers have the ability to collect resources for whatever seems to be essential and then command
    their subjects to carry out the vision. Autocrats had some of the most powerful militaries in history.
    They're helpful for keeping an eye on both their own people and invading neighbors. Autocrats don't have
    to worry about anybody since they set their own rules and have unchallenged power. The Great Wall, the
    Taj Mahal, and other great wonders of civilization have all been the brainchild of autocrats. The kings
    built such marvels in the sake of immortality, celebrating a war win, devotion to their loved ones,
    garnering popularity, and employing unskilled and semi-skilled workers as well as brilliant
    craftsmen.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?</span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; Feudalism is defined as a dominant social system that existed in Europe during the Middle Ages in which
    people worked and fought for nobles who gave them protection and the use of land in return.
    <br><br>
    <b>Pros of feudalism</b>
    <br>
    Feudalism helped protect communities from the violence and warfare that broke out after the fall of Rome
    and the collapse of strong central government in Western Europe. Feudalism secured Western Europe's
    society and kept out powerful invaders. The Lords were the major persons who keep away people's worries.
    Feudalism helped people to develop the qualities like loyalty, bravery, generosity, and humility.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cons of feudalism</b>
    <br>
    The concept of feudalism used to divide poor and rich people into two classes. It created class
    divisions among people. Common and weak people had to be dependent upon the Lords. Easy environment for
    powerful people to impose their power over others. Lords could easily do whatever they wanted. Peasants
    had to survive under the lords and they were not allowed to leave their lords' land. They were
    restricted in movement and even daily activities without their lords' permission.

    <h3>Writing</h3>

    <span>a. Write an email to your friend living abroad stating the contributions of Prithvi Narayan Shah in the
        unification of Nepal.</span>
    <br><br>
    <b>To:</b> sharmashreya@gmail.com
    <br><br>
    <b>From:</b> ritesh7765@gmail.com
    <br><br>
    <b>Subject:</b> Contributions of Prithivi Narayan Shah in the Unification of Nepal
    <br><br>
    Following the recent discussions on the above subject, here are more clarifications on the immeasurable
    contributions that Prithivi Narayan Shah brought to ensure that Nepal is what it is today.
    <br><br>
    Shah ended the divisions and infighting that existed between the four major Nepalese principalities of Gorkha,
    Malla, Patan, and Bhadgaon. Though the prince was a very ambitious member of the Shah ruling family of Gorkha, his
    personal involvement brought the wars among Malla, Patan, and Bhadgaon to an end.
    <br><br>
    He did not stop there. He resolved their long-term differences and consolidated them to become modern-day Nepal.
    Shah also worked hard to strengthen the unity of Nepal. This unity ended the many years when foreigners could easily
    invade any of the small states to conquer them.
    <br><br>
    No doubt, you will appreciate that this was not a mere achievement. While others were dividing nations, he united.
    While others conquered nations for their selfish interests, he strengthened Nepal for national unity.
    <br><br>
    From this brief email, you will appreciate that Shah made lasting contributions to the Nepal we can call home today.
    <br><br>
    From your friend,
    <br>
    Ritesh
