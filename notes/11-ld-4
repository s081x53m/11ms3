                a. Why is the Zhou Age called a feudal age?<br>
                &#10140; The Zhou Age is called a feudal age because it had a strong resemblance to some of the forms of
                feudalism in medieval Europe.<br>
                <br>
                b. What is the location advantage of the Qin?<br>
                &#10140; The territory of the Quin State in modern Shaanxi Province is well guarded from the east by
                mountains and gorges and has easy access to the North China plain through the Yellow River passes. No
                major battle ever took place in the Qin&rsquo;s heartland.<br>
                <br>
                c. What contributed to the success in the warfare as described in the text?<br>
                &#10140; The location of the state, their size of the army, and their expert use of the chariot
                contributed to their success in warfare.<br>
                <br>
                d. Why did the Qin invite the foreign advisor, Shang Yang?<br>
                &#10140; The Qin invited the foreign advisor, Shang Yang to suggest them the idea of state policy.<br>
                <br>

                &#10140; Fear and control were the key features the Qin political system.<br>
                <br>
                f. How were the people treated during the Qin Period?<br>
                &#10140; During the Quin Period, those who contributed the most to the state were highly rewarded while
                those whose live were considered of no consequence were sent to work as slaves on Shi Huangdi's building
                projects such as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, and the roads.<br>
                <br>
                g. Why did Shi Huangdi stop educating ordinary people?<br>
                &#10140; Shi Huangdi stopped educating ordinary people because he believed that uneducated people were
                easier to control.<br>
                <br>
                h. What did the Qin achieve by the legalism in practice?<br>
                &#10140; The Qin achieved the efficiency and strength of the state, a superior army, a disciplined
                bureaucracy, an obedient populace, and the unquestioned a uthority of a strong central government by the
                legalism in practice.<br>
                <br>
                i. Why did Shi Huangdi never sleep in the same room for two consecutive nights?<br>
                &#10140; Shi Huangdi never slept in the same room for two consecutive nights because of constant fear of
                assassination.<br>
                <br>
                j. What are the everlasting marks of the Qin Dynasty?<br>
                &#10140; The everlasting marks of the Qin Dynasty are as follows:<br>
                1. Concept of Legalism<br>
                2. The Terracotta Army<br>
                3. The Great Wall of China<br>
                4. The Grand Canal<br>
                5. Roads.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking<br>
                a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or
                against this statement.<br>
                <br>
                &#10140; In an autocracy, power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual. Fear and control are
                features of the authoritarian political system. Absolute monarchs and military dictators have
                historically served as instances of autocracy. When rapid and definite action is required, autocracy has
                a significant benefit in that important choices can be taken swiftly. Autocratic leaders often make
                decisions based on their own ideas and judgments, and they seldom take input from their followers.<br>
                <br>
                The rulers have the ability to collect resources for whatever seems to be essential and then command
                their subjects to carry out the vision. Autocrats had some of the most powerful militaries in history.
                They're helpful for keeping an eye on both their own people and invading neighbors. Autocrats don't have
                to worry about anybody since they set their own rules and have unchallenged power. The Great Wall, the
                Taj Mahal, and other great wonders of civilization have all been the brainchild of autocrats. The kings
                built such marvels in the sake of immortality, celebrating a war win, devotion to their loved ones,
                garnering popularity, and employing unskilled and semi-skilled workers as well as brilliant
                craftsmen.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?<br><br>
                &#10140; Feudalism is defined as a dominant social system that existed in Europe during the Middle Ages in which
                people worked and fought for nobles who gave them protection and the use of land in return.<br>
                <br>
                Pros of feudalism<br>
                Feudalism helped protect communities from the violence and warfare that broke out after the fall of Rome
                and the collapse of strong central government in Western Europe. Feudalism secured Western Europe's
                society and kept out powerful invaders. The Lords were the major persons who keep away people's worries.
                Feudalism helped people to develop the qualities like loyalty, bravery, generosity, and humility.<br>
                <br>
                Cons of feudalism<br>
                The concept of feudalism used to divide poor and rich people into two classes. It created class
                divisions among people. Common and weak people had to be dependent upon the Lords. Easy environment for
                powerful people to impose their power over others. Lords could easily do whatever they wanted. Peasants
                had to survive under the lords and they were not allowed to leave their lords' land. They were
                restricted in movement and even daily activities without their lords' permission.<br>
                <br>
