Critical thinking<br>
a. Do you agree with Machiavelli's view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest things in order to preserve his power and protect his government? Explain.<br>
A decent leader may occasionally lose his path and become unethical and wicked, according to many facts. He amasss political power and riches in an erroneous manner. Political power and status have been shown to be addictive. A person is rarely uninterested in leaving his or her current job. When a leader engages in unethical behaviour, he disobeys and violates established norms in order to preserve his authority and position. He commits a succession of errors in order to show himself honourable and honest, maintain his authority, and defend his country.<br>
 <br>
Leaders who want power, unlimited riches, or the celebrity that comes with achievement often seem self-centered. This urge is so powerful that it causes leaders to disregard the moral norms that previously guided their actions. Many leaders rise to power by forcing their will on others, sometimes even eliminating those who stand in their way. They may suspect that others are attempting to knock them off their base once they reach the top.<br>
 <br>
Before taking on a leadership position, everyone should consider what their leadership's purpose is. If the genuine response is power, status, and money, leaders risk becoming addicted to external pleasure.<br>
 <br>
b. Do you think that art and literature are important assets of a country? Give reasons.<br>
 <br>
Art and literature are valuable in terms of social, cultural, and economic considerations. They are our identity because they represent the entire country. These entities are on par with other national items in terms of quality. A work of art or literature has cultural and social significance. They enable people from many cultures and eras to communicate with one another through sights and sounds.<br>
 <br>
Art or literature is often used as a tool for social change. It has the potential to offer those who are politically or socially disadvantaged a voice. Their popularity aids the society in gaining international recognition. Art and literature have practical applications in society. They are essential commercially as well as fulfilling the human desire for self-expression. Many people are employed in their production, administration, and distribution. Art and literary works have the potential to contribute to national revenue.<br>
