    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you agree with Machiavelli&#8217;s view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest
        things in
        order to preserve his power and protect his government? Explain.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Machaivelli was a politician and writer. He was born in
    Florence in 1469. His best-known book is &#8216;The Prince&#8217;. In that book, he teaches
    about political
    leaders. he describes how to keep power by any means, immoral decisions, dishonesty, killing,
    etc. Machaivelli
    reveals several facts that a good leader can turn into immoral and evil. The leader accumulates
    political power
    and wealth in a wrong way. Political power and position are like addiction. A powerful person
    never wants to
    lose the position he holds.
    <br>
    <br>
    The leader whose goal is power, fame and boundless wealth, he often appears self-centered.&nbsp;
    The
    leader&#8217;s desire becomes so strong that he breaks the moral standards. Many leaders get to
    the top position
    by imposing their will on others. When they reach the top, they suspect that other leaders are
    trying to knock
    off their base. Therefore, when a leader involves in the dishonest activities, he disobeys and
    breaks the rules
    to save his power and position. To prove himself good and honest, he preserve his power and
    protect his
    government. He makes a series of mistakes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Do you think that art and literature are important assets of a country? Give
        reasons.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Art and literature have social, cultural and economic
    value. They represent the society and nation and their identity. Art may be as paintings,
    sculpture, music,
    dance, film, cartoon and even fashion and furniture design. Literature may be as written work
    with artistic
    value, body of music, printed information and production of literature work. In digital world,
    arts and
    literature may be in the form of digital like digital paintings and eBooks etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    Arts and literatures allow the people to communicate with each other through images, sounds and
    stories. This
    communication may be national wise and international wise. Art of literature is often a medium
    for social
    change. They can give a voice to the social as well as political. The Geeta, the Bible, the
    Quran, etc. are the
    literature value of the countries. Painting of the Mona Lisa, The Card Players, the When Will
    You Marry, the
    Interchange have the million dollars value. Thus we can say that art and literature are
    important assets of a
    country.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Write an essay on “Literature is the reflection of society.”</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Literature is the Reflection of Society</p>

    During the early days, much of our
    history was transferred
    orally through song and spoken word. People started writing things down on scrolls and
    books. Writing made
    accurately transfer of the information much more reliable. Finally, literature was born and
    more people piled
    the written works. It began taking shape in various forms like poetry, epics, novels and
    much more.
    <br><br>
    Literature is the written works with artistic value e.g. fiction, poetry, drama and
    criticism. Literature is
    recognized as having important or permanent artistic value. It may be converting into a
    tangible object that can
    be interpreted by others. In many instances, literature is purely the reflection of society
    and language is its
    voice. The existence of any society can&#8217;t be imagined without literature and language.
    A society is
    incomplete without language, literature, history and culture. Literature provides the big
    picture of the
    society. It shows us the evolution of society through the works produced. When you look or
    stare yourself in a
    mirror, you appear the same way you are. Literature will be seen in the same way as society
    is because a writer
    writes the same article that he seems or hears in society.
    <br><br>
    Literature will enable us to objectively look at the &#8216;bigger picture&#8217;. It helps to
    us to gain
    understanding about different perspectives.
