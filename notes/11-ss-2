                Summary<br>
                <br>
                &lsquo;The Oval Portrait&rsquo; (1842) is one of the shortest tales Edgar Allan Poe ever wrote. In just
                a few pages, he
                offers a powerful story about the relationship between art and life, through the narrator&rsquo;s
                encounter with the
                oval portrait of a young woman in a chateau in the Apennines. The story repays close analysis because of
                the way Poe
                offers his story as a subtle commentary on link between life and art. <br>
                <br>
                First, a brief summary of this briefest of stories. The narrator, wounded and delirious, has sought
                shelter in an old
                mansion with his valet or manservant, Pedro. He holes up in one of the rooms, and contemplates the
                strange paintings
                adorning the walls of the room, and reads a small book he had found on the pillow of the bed, which
                contains information
                about the paintings. At around midnight, he adjusts the candelabrum in the room and his eye catches a
                portrait he
                hadn&rsquo;t previously noticed, in an oval-shaped frame, depicting a young girl on the threshold of
                womanhood. <br>
                <br>
                The narrator is captivated by this portrait, which seems so life-like; but he soon becomes appalled by
                it. He turns to
                the book and reads the entry detailing the history behind the oval portrait. The woman depicted in it
                was the young
                bride of the painter, and was a perfect wife in every respect &ndash; except that she was jealous of her
                husband&rsquo;s
                art that distracted him from her. The artist paints a portrait of his wife, and becomes more and more
                obsessed with
                capturing her likeness, until he ends up spending all of his time gazing at the portrait of his wife,
                and hardly any
                time looking at her. She becomes weaker and weaker, dispirited from losing her husband&rsquo;s love as
                he stops paying
                her attention and becomes more and more preoccupied with the painting. When he has just about finished
                the portrait and
                turns to regard his wife, it is to find that she has died.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Understanding the text<br>
                <br>
                Answer these questions.<br>
                a. Where did the narrator and his servant make forcible entrance?<br>
                &#10140; The narrator and his servant made a forcible entrance in a desolate Chateau which was located
                in the Apennines
                of central Italy.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Which special picture did the narrator notice in the room?<br>
                &#10140; The narrator noticed an oval-shaped picture of a young girl in the room.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. Describe the portrait that the narrator saw in the room.<br>
                &#10140; The picture was in an oval frame. It showed the young woman's head and shoulders. The arms,
                bosom, and even the
                ends of the radiant hair dissolved untraceably into the unclear yet deep shadow which formed the
                background of the
                whole.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. What is the relationship between the portrait painter and its subject?<br>
                &#10140; The relationship between the portrait painter and its subject is of Husband and wife.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context<br>
                a. What is the central theme of the story? Who is the woman depicted in the oval portrait?<br>
                &#10140; The central theme in &ldquo;The Oval Portrait&rdquo; presents the confusing relationship
                between art and life.
                This story has shown the destructive power or the addiction of art and love. Both art and love can lead
                anyone towards
                perfection whereas they can bring destructive results in anyone&rsquo;s life too. Although the artist of
                this story has
                become successful through his artistic work, his wife became a victim. On the other hand, she lost her
                husband so
                extremely that she doesn&rsquo;t reveal her pains and sufferings and lose her life. This story also
                suggests that a
                women&rsquo;s beauty condensed her to death. The story has tried to reveal that excessive passion for
                something always
                gives bad results.<br>
                <br>
                The woman depicted in the oval portrait is the wife of a passionate painter who has painted this oval
                portrait.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; is a short horror story by Edgar Allan Poe involving the disturbing
                circumstances
                surrounding a portrait in a chateau. Elaborate.<br>
                &#10140; This short story has presented a terrible and gloomy setting of a desolate Chateau in one of
                the mountains
                range (Apennines) of central Italy. The Chateau which we find here in this story is completely deserted
                and very old
                fashioned. The setting inside and outside seem very terrible. The apartments inside Chateau are so
                unmanaged and dirty.
                The apartment where the narrator and his valet stay has many things for decoration but all of them are
                in decaying
                state. The life-like portrait has been placed in one of the dark corners. The surrounding of the
                lifelike portrait is so
                disturbing due to the unmanaged condition everywhere. The arrival of the visitors also has added
                disturbance in the
                environment. The portrait seems quite valueless in that desolate environment of the Chateau. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; suggests that the woman's beauty condemns her to death. Discuss.<br>
                &#10140; The references of the painting state that the young lady in the portrait is very beautiful. She
                loses her life
                because her husband compels her to sit for many weeks in an attempt to make the most beautiful portrait
                of her. Though
                the lady sits next to her husband, he is so immersed in his painting to create a beautiful portrait of
                his wife. But he
                doesn&rsquo;t realize his wife's life withdrawing from her body slowly. It reveals the sad reality of
                the husband's
                failure to witness the beauty of his wife. As he was an artist, he wants to treasure it in the form of a
                portrait. In
                this way, her beauty condemns her to own death.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. Discuss the story as a frame narrative (a story within a story).<br>
                &#10140; The frame narrative is a literary technique that reveals about a story within a story. It
                starts with a
                different plot and setting of story but later immerses out with the next story within it. Here, this
                technique reveals
                us how a single story involves the next story within it. The story starts with different information
                about the narrator
                and his valet with a different setting. The readers here move along with the Story's flow at first but
                later on the next
                story starts within it with an amazing description of oval portrait, its detail and background
                information. The readers
                reach up to the next level of the story. The technique of frame narrative works showing a single story
                and the next
                story within it.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. The story is told in a descriptive style, with plenty of imagery and symbolism. Which images and
                symbols do you find
                in the story?<br>
                &#10140; The mansion is abandoned and worn-out. The turret room is in a remote section of the mansion.
                The room is rich
                in decorations, but they are tattered and antique. The walls are full of tapestries, trophies, and
                spirited modern
                paintings. This vivid description of the mansion provides the gothic image. Likewise, the descriptions
                of the portrait
                describe how real and beautiful it is. Although she is dead, she is painted so life-like in the
                portrait.<br>
                <br>
                The dark gloominess of the abandoned house is a classic background for a gothic story. The painter is
                the symbol of the
                fanaticism. The woman in the oval portrait, is the victim of painter's passion for art. The oval
                portrait symbolizes the
                immortality of art. The frame is the symbol of the general objectification she faced as a physically
                attractive
                woman.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                f. What does the expression &ldquo;She was dead!&rdquo; mean?<br>
                &#10140; The expression &quot;She was dead&quot; means the shocking moment of the death of the painter's
                wife on the
                chair. The painter was quite obsessed with his painting. He was engrossed in his task of painting. He
                forgot to inspect
                his wife's condition. He kept on painting his wife's portrait for weeks. When he turned his painting
                towards his wife
                being happy, he found his wife dead posing on the chair. Here, the artwork took the life of its main
                subject.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                <br>
                a. Do you think there is life in art?<br>
                &#10140; &ldquo;The Oval Portrait&rdquo; is a frame story that centers on life and art. The outer story
                follows an
                unnamed narrator who spends a night in a chateau in the Apennines. While he was there, he admires the
                impressive
                paintings but was more obsessed with a portrait of a beautiful young woman which is enclosed in an oval
                frame. Then he
                explores the inner story where he found the tragic life of a beautiful girl whose husband was much
                obsessed with his
                art. He has disengaged himself from reality. For him, his canvas became more real than the reality
                itself which proves
                beneficial for his art but disastrous for his real life. So, in a literary sense, the artist creates
                life in the art and
                tries to find life within it but with a general view, art is just a creation that is created to display
                and has meaning
                related to different things. Thus I don't think there is life in art.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. Explain.<br>
                &#10140; This statement is absolutely right about painting. Painting is really a very admirable form of
                art. The
                painters really work hard to create quality paintings with meanings. The painting itself speaks in its
                literal manner.
                Painting provides us with facts related to life. Here in this story, the oval portrait is one of the
                finest examples
                which has startled the narrator. He feels completely puzzled to see that painting. He wants to know
                about its and
                painter.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. A more intense look at the painting reveals the illusion. Have you noticed any such painting?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, I have noticed such painting. The painting becomes more meaningful when it is watched by
                the viewer who is
                passionate about paintings. But, for those viewers who don't have an idea about paintings find illusion
                all the time. In
                my case, I watched a typical painting for a long time but I didn't get meanings about it. I tried a lot
                to grasp its
                meaning but vain. Later on, I got its meaning from my friend.<br>
