                Comprehension<br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. Why is freewriting also called &lsquo;automatic writing&rsquo;?<br>
                &#10140; Freewriting is also called 'automatic writing&rsquo; because it is performed without any
                conscious control to achieve a spontaneous expression.<br>
                <br>
                b. How do you differentiate writing from speaking?<br>
                &#10140; Writing has the advantage of permitting more editing but speaking doesn&rsquo;t have.<br>
                <br>
                c. What is the biggest obstacle in the writing process, according to Elbow? Do you agree with him? Why?
                Why not?<br>
                &#10140; According to Elbow, editing is the biggest obstacle in the writing process. This is because a
                series of editing can diminish the natural creativity the mind discharges.<br>
                <br>
                d. How can freewriting overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo;?<br>
                &#10140; Freewriting can overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo; as it is non - editing.<br>
                <br>
                e. What do you mean by &lsquo;voice&rsquo; in writing?<br>
                &#10140; Voice is the combination of a sound, texture, and rhythm and the main source of power in
                writing.<br>
                <br>
                f. Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting &ldquo;is like writing something and putting it in a
                bottle in the sea.&rdquo; What does this mean? Explain.<br>
                &#10140; The given expression means freewriting helps somebody by providing no feedback.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Critical thinking<br>
                a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay? What is he trying to communicate to the
                readers?<br>
                &#10140; Here in this essay &quot;Freewriting&quot;, the author persuades his readers using his various
                ideas, examples as well as supportive opinions. Here, the author has put forward his opinions related to
                writing skills and their improvements through the process of freewriting.<br>
                <br>
                The author here in this essay has suggested his tips to improve writing skills for all his readers.
                According to him, the best way to improve writing skill is freewriting. Freewriting should be done
                repeatedly to enhance writing skills. He calls it automatic writing where a writer can put forward
                his/her feelings in a spontaneous way. Freewriting never accepts feedback. He further adds the most
                important part of free writing is 'non-editing'. For him, editing is the greatest obstacle in the
                writing process. The habit of compulsive and premature editing prevents the creativity of the writer.
                The process of writing becomes hard as well as dead through the process of editing. For the author,
                freewriting should be kept away from the editing process which hampers the authentic feelings and
                natural way of the writer. According to him, the main source of power in our writing is 'a voice' which
                includes a sound, a rhythm and a texture. It is the force that makes readers listen to the writers. It
                is the energy that drives the meanings into the thick skull.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Elbow said, freewriting &ldquo;is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and
                putting them down on the page.&rdquo; Do you agree with his statement? Why? Why not?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, I agree with his statement. Freewriting can be done quickly, regardless of how logical or
                nonsensical it is. In freewriting, one does not need to focus on spelling, grammar, etc. In freewriting,
                we express whatever comes to mind on a given subject. Regular freewriting breaks the habit of editing
                while writing. It will free up your writing. What we write is just for us to read until we share our
                effort with others. It will help us edit. Constant freewriting practice improves our writing skills.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write?
                What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?<br>
                &#10140; I learnt writing after learning English grammar and sentence structure. Before high school
                level, writing in English was one of the complicated tasks for me. When I was in 9th grade, I could
                hardly manage half of the paragraph on the assigned topic. My work would lose proper grammatical
                structures, suitable vocabularies and coherence. The most problematic part was generation of
                vocabularies. When I sat for any piece of writing, words couldn&rsquo;t come easily. Some of my friends
                would go through any writing assignment comfortably. Their writings were greatly admired in the
                classroom. I wished I could write like them. I talked to my teacher about my difficulty. He suggested me
                not to panic and practice freewriting exercises regularly and encouraged me to read as many English
                texts as I could. Then, I followed the advice very strictly. I enriched my vocabulary and learnt the
                sentence structures with correct grammatical rules. Now, I can allow myself to complete any sort of
                writing easily but I still get troubled with accumulation of appropriate words.<br>
