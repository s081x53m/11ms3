    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why is freewriting also called &lsquo;automatic writing&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Free writing is also called automatic writing because we write in paper without consciousness or simply
    we
    write without doing any edits or modification in the words that come in our mind.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. How do you differentiate writing from speaking?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writing is editable and can be made more logical but it’s not possible in speaking. Writing is
    something
    evidential because it can be examined in future too but speaking is non evidential.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        c. What is the biggest obstacle in the writing process, according to Elbow? Do you agree with him? Why?
        Why not?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; The biggest obstacles in the writing process are the thoughts like what to write, contemplation of
    wrong
    grammar, wordiness of right editing etc. according to the Elbow. I favor his words. If writer started caring
    about
    his grammar, spelling, coherence and editing from first he can’t learn free writing properly.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. How can freewriting overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writers block are thoughts like what to write, how to write coherently, how to write right words and so
    on.
    Such methods tends to be writing than free writing. But free writing allows writer to write whatever he/she want
    without any limitations. Hence free writing overcome writes block.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. What do you mean by &lsquo;voice&rsquo; in writing?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Words, vocabularies and writing style is considered as voice in writing.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        f. Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting &ldquo;is like writing something and putting it in a
        bottle in the sea.&rdquo; What does this mean? Explain.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; If we put something in bottle and put it in the sea, nobody will go to sea again in search of that
    bottle
    and see what’s inside that. Similarly, if we write something in our copy and leave that, it won’t be examined by
    anybody else later.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay? What is he trying to communicate to the
        readers?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; The essay ‘Free Writing’ explains how free writing helps one to improve his/her writing skills. The
    author
    has presented his idea with relevant evidence and supportive discussion to persuade the readers.
    <br>
    <br>
    According to the author, the most effective way to improve one’s writing is to do free writing exercises
    repeatedly.
    The free writing is spontaneous and accepts no feedback. It must never comment at all. The essay reveals that
    the
    main thing about free writing is that it is non-editable. Editing is necessary if we want to end up our writing
    with
    some satisfactory. The habit of compulsive and premature editing makes our writing hard and dead. The essayist
    believes that there is a mixture of a sound, texture and rhythm called as voice. The voice is the main source of
    power in our writing and carries over into the regular writing.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        b. Elbow said, freewriting &ldquo;is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and
        putting them down on the page.&rdquo; Do you agree with his statement? Why? Why not?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I agree with his statement. Freewriting is an exercise in bringing together the process of
    producing
    words and putting them down on the page. It can be done in a short period of time without stopping, no matter
    how
    coherent or incoherent it is. In free writing one doesn’t need to be concentrated on spelling, grammar and
    similar
    ideas. When we do free writing, we express whatever comes into our mind on the specific topic. By practicing
    regular, free writing undergoes the inbuilt habit of editing at the same time we are trying to produce. It will
    make
    writing less blocked. It doesn’t matter what we write as freewriting is only for us to read unless we share our
    work
    with others. It will solve our editing and enhance our writing skills.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write?
        What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writing was one of the most difficult task for me. When I was in the intermediate grade, I could hardly
    manage to write half of the paragraph on the assigned topic. My work would lose proper grammatical structure,
    suitable vocabularies and coherence. The most problematic part was generation of vocabularies. When I sat for
    any
    piece of writing, words come easily. Some of my friends would deal through any writing assignment comfortably.
    Their
    writings were greatly admired in the classroom. I wished I could write like them. I talked to my teacher about
    my
    difficulty. She suggested me not to be panicked and practice free writing exercises regularly. She also
    encouraged
    me to recall as many English text as I could. Then I followed her advice very strictly. I enriched my vocabulary
    and
    learnt the sentences structure with correct grammatical rules. Now I can allow myself to complete any sort of
    writing easily but I still get trouble with accumulation of appropriate words.

    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    My School Library is a storehouse of books. It has a lot of different types of books. There are different
    subjects&rsquo; books in my School library. Students can get book issued in their library card. There re also

    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. Moral Values I Like Most </span>
    <br>
    Moral values are the principles and ethics that help us to live an honest life. It keeps our life on the right
    path.
    besides this, honesty and truthfulness are great moral values I like most. When we are honest and live by truth,
    there is not fear of corruption and violence. In this condition, there will be greater peace all around. We need
    to
    be courageous, bold, honest and truthful. It is easy to tell a lie and get benefit but we should try to live by
    truth. The truth may hurt us or someone but we may have to uphold the reality. We have to accept the truth at
    all
    times even the unfavorable time. We shouldn&rsquo;t be jealous others&rsquo; belongings. We should do smart work

    earn money without cheating other persons. <br>
