    <h3>Comprehension</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why is freewriting also called &lsquo;automatic writing&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Free writing is also called automatic writing because we write in paper without consciousness or simply we write without doing any edits or modification in the words that come in our mind.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>b. How do you differentiate writing from speaking?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writing is editable and can be made more logical but it’s not possible in speaking. Writing is something evidential because it can be examined in future too but speaking is non evidential.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        c. What is the biggest obstacle in the writing process, according to Elbow? Do you agree with him? Why?
        Why not?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The biggest obstacles in the writing process are the thoughts like what to write, contemplation of wrong grammar, wordiness of right editing etc. according to the Elbow. I favor his words. If writer started caring about his grammar, spelling, coherence and editing from first he can’t learn free writing properly.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>d. How can freewriting overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writers block are thoughts like what to write, how to write coherently, how to write right words and so on. Such methods tends to be writing than free writing. But free writing allows writer to write whatever he/she want without any limitations. Hence free writing overcome writes block.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>e. What do you mean by &lsquo;voice&rsquo; in writing?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Words, vocabularies and writing style is considered as voice in writing.
    <br>

    <br>
    <span>
        f. Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting &ldquo;is like writing something and putting it in a
        bottle in the sea.&rdquo; What does this mean? Explain.
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; If we put something in bottle and put it in the sea, nobody will go to sea again in search of that bottle and see what’s inside that. Similarly, if we write something in our copy and leave that, it won’t be examined by anybody else later.

    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay? What is he trying to communicate to the
        readers?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The essay ‘Free Writing’ explains how free writing helps one to improve his/her writing skills. The author has presented his idea with relevant evidence and supportive discussion to persuade the readers.
    <br>
    <br>
    According to the author, the most effective way to improve one’s writing is to do free writing exercises repeatedly. The free writing is spontaneous and accepts no feedback. It must never comment at all. The essay reveals that the main thing about free writing is that it is non-editable. Editing is necessary if we want to end up our writing with some satisfactory. The habit of compulsive and premature editing makes our writing hard and dead. The essayist believes that there is a mixture of a sound, texture and rhythm called as voice. The voice is the main source of power in our writing and carries over into the regular writing.

        b. Elbow said, freewriting &ldquo;is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and
        putting them down on the page.&rdquo; Do you agree with his statement? Why? Why not?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Yes, I agree with his statement. Freewriting is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them down on the page. It can be done in a short period of time without stopping, no matter how coherent or incoherent it is. In free writing one doesn’t need to be concentrated on spelling, grammar and similar ideas. When we do free writing, we express whatever comes into our mind on the specific topic. By practicing regular, free writing undergoes the inbuilt habit of editing at the same time we are trying to produce. It will make writing less blocked. It doesn’t matter what we write as freewriting is only for us to read unless we share our work with others. It will solve our editing and enhance our writing skills.

        c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write?
        What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Writing was one of the most difficult task for me. When I was in the intermediate grade, I could hardly manage to write half of the paragraph on the assigned topic. My work would lose proper grammatical structure, suitable vocabularies and coherence. The most problematic part was generation of vocabularies. When I sat for any piece of writing, words come easily. Some of my friends would deal through any writing assignment comfortably. Their writings were greatly admired in the classroom. I wished I could write like them. I talked to my teacher about my difficulty. She suggested me not to be panicked and practice free writing exercises regularly. She also encouraged me to recall as many English text as I could. Then I followed her advice very strictly. I enriched my vocabulary and learnt the sentences structure with correct grammatical rules. Now I can allow myself to complete any sort of writing easily but I still get trouble with accumulation of appropriate words.
