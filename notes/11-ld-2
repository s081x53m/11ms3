Comprehension<br>
Answer the following questions.<br>
a. Why is freewriting also called &lsquo;automatic writing&rsquo;?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
Freewriting is also called 'automatic writing&rsquo; because it is performed without any conscious control to achieve a spontaneous expression.<br>
 <br>
b. How do you differentiate writing from speaking?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
Writing has the advantage of permitting more editing but speaking doesn&rsquo;t have.<br>
 <br>
c. What is the biggest obstacle in the writing process, according to Elbow? Do you agree with him? Why? Why not?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
According to Elbow, editing is the biggest obstacle in the writing process. This is because a series of editing can diminish the natural creativity the mind discharges.<br>
 <br>
d. How can freewriting overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo;?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
Freewriting can overcome &lsquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rsquo; as it is non - editing.<br>
 <br>
e. What do you mean by &lsquo;voice&rsquo; in writing?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
Voice is the combination of a sound, texture, and rhythm and the main source of power in writing.<br>
 <br>
f. Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting &ldquo;is like writing something and putting it in a bottle in the sea.&rdquo; What does this mean? Explain.<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
The given expression means freewriting helps somebody by providing no feedback.<br>
 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay? What is he trying to communicate to the readers?<br>
 <br>
Writing is a talent that may be improved via freewriting. To convince the audience, the author provided pertinent evidence and debate.<br>
According to the author, freewriting activities are the most efficient method to enhance one's writing. The freewriting is unreflective. It must never be analysed, discussed, or commented upon. The article shows that freewriting is non-editing. Editing is frequently required to finish our content. Editing compulsively and prematurely kills our writing. The writer thinks that a voice is a combination of tone, texture, and rhythm. The voice is the primary source of strength in our writing.<br>
 <br>
b. Elbow said, freewriting &ldquo;is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them down on the page.&rdquo; Do you agree with his statement? Why? Why not?<br>
 <br>
Freewriting can be done quickly, regardless of how logical or nonsensical it is. In freewriting, one does not need to focus on spelling, grammar, etc. In freewriting, we express whatever comes to mind on a given subject. Regular freewriting breaks the habit of editing while writing. It will free up your writing. What we write is just for us to read until we share our effort with others. It will help us edit. Constant freewriting practise improves our writing skills.<br>
 <br>
c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write? What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?<br>
 <br>
For me, writing was one of the most difficult jobs. I could hardly complete half of the paragraph on the given subject while I was in intermediate school. My writing would lose its consistency, grammatical structures, and appropriate vocabulary. The creation of vocabulary was the most difficult aspect. Words didn't come readily to me when I sat down to write anything. Some of my pals would breeze through any writing task with ease. In the classroom, their works were well regarded. I wish I could write as well as they do. I discussed my difficulties with my instructor. He advised me not to be alarmed and to do freewriting activities on a regular basis, as well as to read as many English texts as possible. Then I followed the instructions to the letter. I increased my vocabulary and learned how to construct sentences using proper grammatical principles. I can now enable myself to quickly finish any kind of writing, but I still struggle with the accumulation of suitable words.<br>
