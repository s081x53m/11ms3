f. How have the developed countries become prosperous?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
The developed countries have become prosperous because they have always given research and innovation the topmost priority and they are investing huge amount of money for that.<br>
 <br>
g. How can we keep the most talented and innovative people in Nepal?<br>
 <br>
Answer:<br>
We can keep the most talented and innovative people in Nepal creating sound environment and support system.<br>
 <br>
Critical thinking<br>
a. Pun says, &ldquo;We do not have culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and creative&rdquo;. Do you agree with him? Explain.<br>
 <br>
In order for the economy to grow, innovation is essential. Economically successful countries have prioritised research and innovation, and they have invested significant sums of money in promoting its creative residents. In addition to their academic performance, students should strive to develop innovative ideas. Our schools, colleges, and universities do not place a high priority on research and creative ideas.<br>
 <br>
 Our education system is still based on paper and classrooms, and it hasn't changed much over the years. Innovative and creative thinking are not encouraged in our educational system. Every year, thousands of students leave the country in pursuit of a higher education because of this. A research-based education is usually given the highest emphasis in industrialised nations. To do this, they invest a great deal of money and effort. Our culture discourages young people from taking risks, therefore there are no possibilities for them in Nepal. <br>
 <br>
Those that are skilled do not want to remain in Nepal and work there. Creating a solid atmosphere and supporting system for Nepal's most brilliant, inventive, and creative individuals is the government's duty. A notion that must be emphasised in the classroom if we are to create creative minds is that of invention.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. What qualities does an individual need to become an entrepreneur?<br>
It is not simple to start a company. Business ownership involves giving up the comfort and security of a normal &quot;day job&quot; in order to follow a passion or ambition for many individuals. Your positive characteristics may be determined through a thorough and honest self-examination.<br>
 <br>
The path to company success is fraught with obstacles and setbacks for entrepreneurs. Financial assistance or early marketing efforts may be tough to come by. A bankruptcy filing is possible. If your stance is firm, you will need to put in constant work and be persistent in order to succeed as an entrepreneur.<br>
 <br>
Self-discipline is a necessary trait for entrepreneurs. Someone does not compel you to wake up and go to work. Self-discipline is essential for entrepreneurs, regardless of whether it's a bright day or a favourite TV programme.<br>
 <br>
Your chosen business endeavour will occupy the majority of your waking hours. Being passionate about your work, on the other hand, is an essential entrepreneurial characteristic. In other words, if you do not like your quest or do not feel passionately about it, it may simply seem like another work to you. Your success becomes more difficult if you lose interest in your company.<br>
 <br>
In business, your actions determine your success or failure. It's important to keep yourself and your company in the public eye. Entrepreneurs' greatest marketing technique is self-promotion. Through relentless promotion, you must have confidence in yourself and your company concept.<br>
 <br>
As long as your company idea isn't entirely unique, you'll have to contend with competitors. A competitive attitude is required to beat your opponent. In addition to providing a valuable learning experience, the study of the competition is essential.<br>
 <br>
