<br><br>
<br><br>
<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
<br>
<span>a. What is the key takeaway of this essay? Do you think that this essay is satirical? Why?</span>
<br>
The essay aims to change the usual view that superstition is only harbored by the uneducated and irrational people and introduce a different perspective towards superstition. Every individual no matter how logical or rational, carries superstitions, and that is a normal and natural trait although this is not indicated directly. The essayist doesn&rsquo;t make any precise or obvious points about what the essay will be about except that it will revolve around superstition.
<br><br>
The essayist believes that many superstitions are so widespread and so old that must have been risen from a depth of human mind that is indifferent to any race or creed. For him, superstition is associated with a human interest to know his fate and to have its role in deciding it.
<br><br>
The essay is satirical. It makes fun of learned and educated people who have nothing to do with superstition, but believe in it. The essayist uses several examples associated with superstition, from his personal life at the University he lives in, his surroundings and religious studies. These illogical happenings in the essay strongly ridicule the scientific and modern human civilization. Throwing salt over the left shoulder after spilling it or avoiding walking under a ladder resolving a matter related to university affiars by consulting the I Ching, placing jujus, lucky coins and other bringers of luck on the desks of the candidates in an examination hall, etc. are some of the superstitious activities rational persons believe in.
<br><br><br>
<span>b. Can education bring change in the belief of superstition? Present your arguments to support your answer.</span>
<br>
Education has the potential to change superstitious beliefs. It enhances thinking abilities and intellect. People who are educated are less prone to be superstitious, and they may educate others about the harmful behaviour. At the very least, educated people take ill people to the hospital rather than hiring witch doctors to cast out demons to heal them. Education helps people understand illnesses, their causes, and how to treat them.
<br><br>
When someone is afraid of the unknown, they develop superstitions. There is no longer any superstition when the unfamiliar becomes familiar. A person's dread of the mind will be eliminated if they learn the real truth behind different useless things.
<br><br>
True, paranormal experiences are deeply embedded in people's brains. The reason for this is the influence of the society in which they grow up and the cultural activities in which they participate. It is difficult, but not impossible, to eliminate them. It can only be done by educated individuals.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<br>
<span>a. Write an essay on superstitions that exists in your community in about 250 words.</span>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">Superstitions in My Community</p>
<br>
Superstitions are as old as man. The earliest men who had no scientific knowledge fell on easy prey to superstition. Thus, illiteracy and lack of knowledge and capacity to reason out are the hotbeds which generate and perpetuate superstition.
<br><br>
Mahatma Buddha was probably the first great man to expound and explain the value and significance of reason which eliminated superstition altogether. He emphasized that everything should be thoroughly studied, judged and tested before being believed. Later, many other great men like Guru Nanak and Kabir exhorted the people to shun superstitions.
<br><br>
Many people may believe that faith is also a form of superstition. But, as we can see if we think deeply, there is a difference. Faith is a positive factor whereas superstition is a negative factor.
<br><br>
Earlier, superstition was rampant in villages. The belief in ghosts was common. It was believed that these ghosts operated at night and that they were visible to some people and invisible to others. Taking advantage of this many clever men burned into tan tricks and controllers of ghosts. They cheated the gullible villagers. Unfortunately, even at present, such clever men are at work.
<br><br>
There are many kinds of superstitions which are observed by common people. The throbbing of eyes, a cat crossing our way, coming across a Brahmin-all these are believed to be inauspicious. The cawing of a crow indicated the possibility of a guest visiting our house that day. Similarly, if we come across a sweeper early in the morning, it is considered to be auspicious.
<br><br>
We should try to develop a scientific spirit of mind and judge everything on the basis of reason.
