    <br>

    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. What is the key takeaway of this essay? Do you think that this essay is satirical? Why?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    The essay aims to convey the message that we are following superstition knowingly and unknowingly. Every individual
    no matter how logical or rational he/she is, carries superstitions. The essayist believes that many superstitions
    are widespread and too old that must have been risen from a depth of human mind that is indifferent to any race or
    creed.
    <br><br>
    The essay is satirical in the sense that it satirizes to those educated and uneducated people who are the victim of
    it. Throwing salt over the left shoulder after spilling it or avoiding walking under a ladder, resolving a matter
    related to university affairs by consulting the I Ching, placing jujus, lucky coins and other bringers of luck on
    the desks of the candidates in an examination hall, etc. are some of the superstitious activities he satires on.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Can education bring change in the belief of superstition? Present your arguments to support your
        answer.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Education may or may not bring change in the belief of superstition. Education can make people less superstitious.
    At least educated people are more likely to send the sick to the hospital, than to call priests to cast out demons
    in order to cure the sick. Education provides an understanding of the diseases, the cause and the cure of the
    diseases. Superstitions are due to fear of the unknown. Once the unknown becomes known, there is no longer any
    superstition. Education has the potential to change superstitious beliefs. It enhances thinking abilities and
    intellect. People who are educated are less prone to be superstitious, and they may educate others about it too.
    <br><br>
    Now the question is can education eradicate superstition? It is only possible when human beings gain complete
    knowledge of everything, then education is able to eradicate superstition. For the present, education does reduce a
    lot of superstitious beliefs around the world.
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Write an essay on superstitions that exists in your community in about 250 words.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">Superstitions in My Community</p>
    <br>
    Superstitions are as old as man. The earliest men who had no scientific knowledge fell on easy prey to superstition.
    Thus, illiteracy and lack of knowledge and capacity to reason out are the hotbeds which generate and perpetuate
    superstition.
    <br><br>
    Mahatma Buddha was probably the first great man to expound and explain the value and significance of reason which
    eliminated superstition altogether. He emphasized that everything should be thoroughly studied, judged and tested
    before being believed. Later, many other great men like Guru Nanak and Kabir exhorted the people to shun
    superstitions.
    <br><br>
    Many people may believe that faith is also a form of superstition. But, as we can see if we think deeply, there is a
    difference. Faith is a positive factor whereas superstition is a negative factor.
    <br><br>
    Earlier, superstition was rampant in villages. The belief in ghosts was common. It was believed that these ghosts
    operated at night and that they were visible to some people and invisible to others. Taking advantage of this many
    clever men burned into tan tricks and controllers of ghosts. They cheated the gullible villagers. Unfortunately,
    even at present, such clever men are at work.
    <br><br>
    There are many kinds of superstitions which are observed by common people. The throbbing of eyes, a cat crossing our
    way, coming across a Brahmin-all these are believed to be inauspicious. The cawing of a crow indicated the
    possibility of a guest visiting our house that day. Similarly, if we come across a sweeper early in the morning, it
    is considered to be auspicious.
    <br><br>
    We should try to develop a scientific spirit of mind and judge everything on the basis of reason.
<br><br><br>
    <span>b. “Superstition is prevalent in every walk of life.” Argue for or against this statement.</span>
    <br><br>
    Yes it is true that superstition is prevalent in every walk of life. The man started to believe in superstitions
    when he got a feeling that humans are at the mercy of natural elements. Similarly, some superstitions were also
    created because of social values. As a result, people worship forces of nature for a long time.
    <br><br>
    The Greeks and Pagans used to worship elements of nature in the form of Gods and Goddesses. Same is the case with
    Nepalese tradition. People continue to worship the sun, moon, stars, planets, plants and more believing these things
    have the power to influence our lives.
    You might have heard ‘it is because of the impact of some evil star’ and more when a disease overtakes or disaster
    strikes. Even the people in the West have been believing in them. You will find instances in Shakespeare’s plays
    where he includes things like omens, witches and more.
    <br><br>
    In fact, ever since a long time till date, people still consider the number 13 to be unlucky. Similarly, salt
    spilling over the dinner table is also an ill-omen. In Nepal, people consider the black cat crossing the way to be
    unlucky. Similar is the case of an owl hooting or a dog wailing.
    <br><br>
    If we look at it closely, there is no logic as such behind the beliefs in superstitions. However, they have grown
    age-old and despite all the scientific advancement, they are not going anywhere soon and hence they are prevalent in
    every walk of life.
