                <br>
                <br>
                Summary <br>
                Once there lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitri Aksenov with his family in the land of Vladimir, who
                in his younger days lived life to the fullest by experiencing all the material things world has to offer
                until he got married.<br>
                <br>
                One summer, he planned to go to Nizhny fair but his wife warned him that she had a bad dream of her
                husband-- she dreamt about Ivan that he returned from the town with hair of grey. Ivan laughed as if he
                doesn't care and went on the fair.<br>
                <br>
                He travelled half way and met a merchant, whom he spent the night drinking tea with and shared an
                adjoining room in the inn. Since Aksenov is not used of sleeping for long hours he decided to wake up
                and continued his journey.<br>
                <br>
                Along the way of his journey, two soldiers in a troika stopped him, and began asking questions, for the
                merchant he met halfway on his travel was found dead. Since all evidences of the crime are pointing
                Aksenov guilty he was imprisoned.<br>
                <br>
                Learning the sad fate of Aksenov, his wife remembered her dream about Aksenov and was worried and even
                considered the thought of her husband being guilty. The thought made Aksenov even sadder.<br>
                <br>
                26 years in prison made Aksenov a well grounded and God-fearing man. In spite the fact that his family
                has completely forgotten him, he still serves as a &ldquo;Grandpa&rdquo; to the other prisoners. Then
                came a new prisoner named Makar Semyonich.<br>
                <br>
                After months of knowing each other, Aksenov discovered that Makar is the one who killed the merchant
                whom he was told he murdered. He was furious with what he found out but didn't speak or uttered a word
                about it.<br>
                <br>
                Until one night, Aksenov heard some earth rolling under where the prisoners were sleeping. He went out
                and saw Makar. Makar told him not to tell a word about what he had witnessed or else he will kill
                him.<br>
                <br>
                When they were led out to work, a soldier noticed a prisoner took of some earth off his boots. The
                soldier searched for escaping plans and found the tunnel. Then, they asked each of them who knew about
                this but they denied for they knew they will be killed before the one who did it as Makar warned them.
                Finally, the governor asked Ivan for he knew he was a just man. But then Ivan said it wasn't his right
                or his will but God's to tell such name.<br>
                <br>
                Night fell and Makar went to Ivan. He thanked him and felt sorry for what he had done to him a long time
                ago that made Ivan suffer for all this years. He sobbed as well as Ivan and said that the Lord will
                forgive you. Makar said that he will confess to the governor so that Ivan would be sent free--back to
                his home.<br>
                <br>
                Ivan did not want to go out of prison for he has no family neither home to back to; rather, he waited
                for his last hour to come.<br>
                <br>
                In spite of what they've talked about, Makar Semyonich confessed his guilt. But when the order for Ivan
                Dmitri Aksenov's release came, he was already dead.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Understanding the text<br>
                a. What bad habits did Aksionov have before his marriage?<br>
                &#10140; He used to drink before his marriage and was riotous when he drank too much.<br>
                <br>
                b. What can be the meaning of his wife's dream? <br>
                &#10140; Her dream is a foreshadowing of Aksionov's tragic destiny.<br>
                <br>
                c. Why did Aksionov think of killing himself? <br>
                &#10140; Aksionov thought of killing himself because he remembered all those harsh situations which he
                had faced in his life without committing any crime. He remembered his torture, the people around him
                while he was in chains, the convicts, twenty-six years of imprisonment, his premature old age etc. All
                these painful thoughts made him so wretched that he was ready to kill himself.<br>
                <br>
                d. Why did Makar disclose that he had killed the merchant? <br>
                &#10140; Makar disclosed that he had killed the merchant because he felt ashamed of himself. He felt
                pity over Aksionov. Aksionov saved Makar from the governor though he was a victim of Makar's crime. The
                act of Aksionov made Makar feel ashamed and disclose his crime. <br>
                <br>
                e. Why doesn't Aksionov wish to return to his family at the end of the story? <br>
                &#10140; Aksionov doesn't wish to return his family at the end of the story because he has become quite
                Old. He has spent his entire life in prison without committing any crime. He is feeble too at this age.
                He desires to die in the prison instead of going to his family.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context<br>
                a. &quot;Well, old man,&quot; repeated the Governor, &quot;tell me the truth: who has been digging under
                the wall?&quot;<br>
                i. Who is that old man?<br>
                &#10140; That old man is Aksionov who has spent his twenty-six years in prison. <br>
                <br>
                ii. Which truth is the speaker asking about? <br>
                &#10140; The speaker is asking about the truth of digging an escape hole.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Which wall does the speaker mean? <br>
                &#10140; The speaker means the prison's wall.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Describe Aksionov's character. <br>
                &#10140; Aksionov is the protagonist of the story &quot;god sees the truth but waits&quot; written by
                Leo Tolstoy. He is a young merchant. He is a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full of fun and
                very fond of singing. He used to drink much before marriage but later on, he changed himself and became
                a good man. He had virtuous qualities such as faith, forgiveness, freedom, and acceptance. His
                comfortable life is disrupted when he is framed for a murder he didn't commit and was sent to a Siberian
                prison camp. He earns a reputation as a good person among the prison officials and fellow prisoners.
                After finding himself imprisoned with the man who framed him, Aksionov is ready to kill himself.
                However, at the end of the story, he is able to forgive Semyonich. He dies shortly before the
                authorities order him to be released.<br>
                <br><br>
                c. What is the theme of the story? <br>
                &#10140; The subject of this story is injustice, acceptance, faith and forgiveness. The Aksionov case is
                not compelling. The government officials declared him guilty without setting any reason or retrieving a
                bloodied knife and 20,000 roubles taken from the merchant. <br>
                <br>
                If the plea of his wife to the Czar is denied, Aksionov realises that he cannot rectify his wrong. He
                commits himself to God to offer him that righteousness which a man cannot give him. <br>
                <br>
                Aksionov becomes a modest and pious person in jail. Officials and inmates appreciate him in settling
                disputes for his neutrality. Aksionov's trust in God is so great that he thinks that he must be wicked
                to deserve God's tortured life. <br>
                <br>
                After Aksionov is reluctant to report the drilling of Semyonich's tunnel, Semyonich is disturbed by the
                compassion of Aksionov. Aksionov eventually gives forgiveness to Semyonich.<br>
                <br><br>
                d. Which symbols are used in the story and what do they indicate? <br>
                &#10140; The story has many symbols for its aesthetic expression, which replaces flat text. The home and
                two businesses of Aksionov symbolise his family and material possessions. The jail itself symbolises the
                agony of Aksionov and the ultimate spiritual change. His grey hair appears as a vivid sign of his
                misery, emphasising not just his age but his punishment-related bodily degradation. <br>
                <br>
                His grey hair shows how he matures prematurely with the stress of his unjust incarceration. The blood
                stained knife discovered unexpectedly among the works of Aksionov is the key evidence needed to condemn
                him. <br>
                <br>
                This knife represents the loss of control over Aksionov's destiny. Aksionov's nickname 'The Lives of the
                Saints' is his religious devotion.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text<br>
                a. What role does religion play in Aksionov's life? How does he undergo a spiritual transformation in
                the story?<br>
                &#10140; In Aksionov's life, religion plays a significant part. He spends all his life in a Siberian jail
                waiting for God's just judgement. The suspicion of his wife's culpability leads him to believe that he
                can depend only on God to know the truth and provide compassion. <br>
                <br>
                He has been in jail for 26 years and loses his young joy and becomes profoundly religious. His life is
                dedicated to God. Aksionov learns how to manufacture boots and makes a little money in jail, buys and
                reads the book 'The Lives of the Saints.' On Sundays he reads the lectures and sings in the choir at the
                prison church. <br>
                <br>
                The jail officials like him even because of his humility. His confreres revere him calling him 'The
                Saint' and 'Grandfather.' When the actual murderer of the merchant comes to jail, Askionov may forgive
                him. He has no desire to return home at the conclusion of the story, but to remain with God.<br>
                <br>
                The spiritual change of Aksionov is unique in history. He is carefree and loves materialistic life
                before incarceration. Although Aksionov rejects the legitimacy of the state that has taken him prisoner,
                he understands that in Siberia the purpose for his suffering is to pay for his crimes. Aksionov believes
                his misery is a test of faith that offers him the opportunity to attain salvation by changing his
                character and dedicating his life to God.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. What does the story tell us about the existence of an unfair system of justice?<br>
                &#10140; The story informs us about the presence of an unjust judicial system via the major life event of
                the protagonist. This story shows a decent and innocent guy unjustly incarcerated on a murder
                accusation, punished for twenty-six years and forced to lose all and his life for no fault or crime of
                his own, but based solely on facts. He suffers a lot during his life, but he realises himself and dies
                quietly.<br>
