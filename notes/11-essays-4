                Understanding the text 
                <br><br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. What is poverty according to Parker?<br>
                &#10140; According to Parker, poverty is a lack of hope, better foods, medical care, proper sanitation,
                and proper education. It's like an acid that eats away at one's pride, honor, health, and future.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. How is poverty difficult for Parker&rsquo;s children? List some specific examples.<br>
                &#10140; Parker's three children suffer a lot due to poverty. They live in hopelessness because of an
                absence of sufficient food, instruction, dress, and clinical consideration. Her most youthful child was
                covered with fly spots and his diaper had not been changed since morning. When she came back she saw her
                most youthful child was covered with fly spots and his diaper had not been changed since morning, other
                kid was playing with broken glasses and the most seasoned one was playing alone at the edge of a lake.
                She needed more pay to concede them at a nursery school. She made 20 dollars per week and a nursery
                school cost 20 dollars per week for three kids. In this way poverty is difficult for Parker&rsquo;s
                children.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. How does Parker try to obtain help, and what problems does she encounter?<br>
                &#10140; Parker tries to get help for her children by spreading her hands in front of various people and
                institutions. Due to a lack of funds, she makes every effort to find supportive hands most of the time.
                Most of the time, she has difficulty locating the appropriate organization and person to assist her. She
                must transfer to new organizations. She has to wait and tell her dreadful story over and over.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. Why are people&rsquo;s opinions and prejudices her greatest obstacles?<br>
                &#10140; People's opinions and prejudices are her greatest obstacles because they prevent her from
                receiving supportive hands for her family's sake. The majority of people are unaware of the agony of
                poverty. Poor people's suffering is insignificant to them. They continue to express their prejudices and
                opinions about poor people. In Parker's case, people's opinions and prejudices prevent her from
                obtaining assistance to run her family.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. How does Parker defend her inability to get help? How does she discount the usual solutions society
                has for poverty (e.g., welfare, education, and health clinics)?<br>
                &#10140; Parker defends her inability to get help and support by expressing her feelings about her
                poverty experiences. She dismisses society's usual solutions to poverty by recounting her own
                experiences with welfare, education, and health clinics. According to her, in the name of welfare, she
                must move and spread her hands in a variety of agencies across the country. She has to deal with shame
                all the time in these organizations. She must repeatedly demonstrate her poverty. She has to retell her
                story several times. Sometimes welfare programs promise to assist, but getting to them takes a long
                time. School launch programs exist in the name of education, but they serve no purpose. She has
                witnessed the condition of her two children after sending them to school. When it comes to the most
                important aspects of health clinics, Parker's life is far from the facilities of health clinics. She has
                to walk for miles to get medical help. If she asks for help, the helper anticipates negative outcomes
                from her. As a result, Parker is completely disconnected from all three critical aspects.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. Explain the following: Poverty is looking into a black future.<br>
                &#10140; This line &ldquo;Poverty is looking into a black future&quot; has been stated by the writer Jo
                Goodwin Parker in her essay. She has put forward this line for her readers to present her experience
                related to poverty. Here in this line, the writer is advising all the readers about an ugly and cruel
                aspect of poverty. According to her, poverty leads people towards the black future. Poor people have to
                live a miserable life on their daily basis. It is quite difficult to manage proper daily foodstuffs for
                them. For them, there is no hope for the upcoming future. They keep on spending their lives in disparity
                looking into a black future. Poverty breaks expectations and dreams of future days.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. What does Parker mean by &ldquo;The poor are always silent&rdquo;?<br>
                &#10140; Parker is referring to poor people's helplessness when she says &quot;the poor are always
                silent.&quot; Money is extremely important in poverty. Money is the perfect solution to all problems.
                Poor people, on the other hand, feel weaker as a result of a lack of resources. They always keep their
                mouths shut in front of others. Because of their pitiful state, they must listen to others' words while
                remaining silent.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a
                recurring pattern? What is it?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, I notice the recurring pattern at the beginning of most of the paragraphs. She uses the
                repetition strategy at the beginning of most of the paragraphs. She uses the repetition &ldquo;Poverty
                is&#8230;&rdquo; to highlight her inner pain and suffering as a poor. She wants to bring readers
                sympathy for all the poor people. Her intention is to make the readers feel about the real picture of
                poor not as in the newspaper. By using the informal repetitive style, she becomes successful to
                establish a relationship between the speaker and the readers.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?<br>
                &#10140; Parker begins each paragraph with her repetition strategy. She begins the majority of her
                paragraphs with a repetition statement such as &quot;Poverty is.&quot; She then shares her personal
                experiences with her topic sentences. The author first makes it clear to her readers that her goal is to
                help them understand what poverty is. Her second goal is to persuade all of her readers to help those in
                need. Each paragraph is memorable because of the details related to her personal painful experiences and
                the harsh reality of poverty.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader in the issue of
                poverty?<br>
                &#10140; The author uses questions in her informal style of direct conversation in the final paragraph
                to engage the readers in the issue of poverty. Parker has done an excellent job of engrossing her
                readers with her persuasive style. She instructs them to look at the poor with an angry heart rather
                than a pitiful heart. This style of question has piqued the readers' emotions as well as their
                attention. In the final paragraph, she has succeeded in drawing her readers' attention to her plight and
                the struggles of others in her situation.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating Parker&rsquo;s style.<br>
                &#10140; <br>
                A Social Problem: Unemployment<br>
                <br>
                Unemployment is one of the burning social problem of the world. It is a bizarre situation where people
                are qualified for the jobs for but not getting it. Many degree holders, teachers, innovators, etc. are
                the victims of this social evil. We are failing to utilize valuable human resource due to unemployment.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most important cause behind it is less availability of jobs. Other causes are defective governmental
                policies, lack of practical skill and increasing population. It is necessary to establish a stable
                government to make plans for youth employment. <br>
                <br>
                Every year, many youths leave their country in a search of better opportunity. Every year, educated
                youths become unemployed due to theoretical knowledge. So, this social evil is devastating for every
                nation. Many educated people are doing traditional farming due to lack of opportunities in the labor
                market. <br>
                <br>
                There are different effects of unemployment. One of the major effect is poverty. In the world,
                unemployed people had the highest rate of poverty. Unemployment also cause health hazards. There is a
                close strong relationship between unemployment and health. Unemployment also causes physical as well as
                mental illness, such as depression. <br>
                <br>
                Summing up, government has to play a very crucial role by minimizing the growing unemployment by
                increasing practical education as well as industrial areas. Population control is also another method to
                reduce it.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Using adjectives to highlight the futility of the situation, write a short definition essay on
                Growing up in Poverty.<br>
                &#10140; <br>
                Essay on Growing Up in Poverty. <br>
                <br>
                Poverty is the devastating social evil of our society. It creates division in a society. People in a
                society is divided between the haves and have-nots. It has political, economic, social, psychological
                and physical effects on poor people. <br>
                <br>
                It is very difficult to grow up in poverty. We fail to fulfill our basic needs like food, shelter and
                clothing. We always become silent in poverty. We are deprived of basic human right in poverty. A person
                loses self-confident, self-esteem, honor and dignity when he/she suffers from it.<br>
                <br>
                The ultimate solution to reduce poverty is to spread practical based free education to all. Government
                should focus on education. In the same way, it is necessary to increase employment opportunities to
                people because poverty and unemployment are interlinked to each other.<br>
                <br>
                However, the circumstance under which life is suffered under the shadow of poverty certainly leaves any
                individual much the worse as it deprives him of the right to achieve his potential as free and equal
                member of society.<br>
                <br>
                Summing up, it is also true that some of the most illuminating examples of humanity, sensitivity and
                empathy has emerged from the darkest recesses of poverty. Life redeems and allows us to hope that better
                access to better opportunities and facilities of life shall perhaps one day help to free them from these
                shackles and allow to live life as an equal and deserving member of the society.<br>
                <br>
