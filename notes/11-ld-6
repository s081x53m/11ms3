Critical thinking<br>
a. What do you do you to keep yourself fit? What food do you avoid and why?<br>
 <br>
Everybody wants to live a healthy lifestyle. However, owing to their hectic schedules, they rarely make any attempt to make it happen. For my part, I think that if there is a will, there will be a way. To be physically and mentally fit, I carefully adhere to good practises. My favourite things to do are go for a brisk stroll in the countryside every morning and play games. My regular meals provide my body with all of the nutrition it needs.<br>
 <br>
In addition, &lsquo;early to bed and early to rise' has been crucial to my good health.<br>
Despite my hectic schedule, I make every effort to prevent<br>
 <br>
 <br>
b. Healthy citizens are the greatest asset of a country. What can a state do to keep her citizen healthy?<br>
 <br>
Investing in the health of a nation's people is the most lucrative investment a country can make. Our country's capacity to develop is inextricably tied to our health. It is insufficient to have a well-educated and competent staff. Productivity requires both physical and mental well-being. When individuals become ill, the repercussions impact families and communities in addition to the nation's well-being.<br>
 <br>
A nation's greatest natural asset is its people, and its prosperity is determined by how well they are cared for. Our healthcare system has an impact on our capacity to participate in global markets. It also contributes significantly to economic development since healthy people live longer and are more productive.<br>
 <br>
Countries that place a low priority on their people' health have shown to have low growth rates. A nation's population must be absolutely fit and healthy in order for it to quickly climb the success ladder. A good healthcare system must be accessible and inexpensive to all people, not just the wealthy.<br>
 <br>
In maintaining a nation's health, both the state and people play an equal responsibility. A government, on the other hand, should be more accountable and capable of making significant measures to enhance public health. It should offer its people with high-quality, nutrient-dense food.<br>
 <br>
It is necessary to ensure that local public health infrastructures are sufficient. It is important to encourage healthy communities and healthy habits. It should be essential to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Environmental health risks should be avoided at all costs.<br>
 <br>
There should be simple access to health services. In distant areas of the nation, health facilities and hospitals should be built.<br>
