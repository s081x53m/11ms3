                <br>


                Understanding the text <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. What is the story about Steve Jobs&rsquo; birth?<br>
                &#10140; Steve Jobs was given birth by an unwed college graduate student. She decided to put her baby
                for adoption during her pregnancy. She wanted her baby to be adopted by an educated family. To adopt
                Steve Jobs, a lawyer's family became ready at first. But, after the birth of Steve Jobs, the lawyer's
                family changed their mind to adopt him. They desired to adopt a baby girl. Later on, a mechanic named
                Paul Jobs and his wife Clara Jobs adopted Steve Jobs with a promise that someday they would send Steve
                to college for his study.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. What does he mean when he says, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward; you can only
                connect them looking backwards&rdquo;?<br>
                &#10140; In Steve Jobs speech, he says that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward; you
                can only connect them looking backwards&rdquo;. It means that life is full of uncertainty and suspense.
                People make plans to get further success but no one can guarantee success. Something is always lacking
                in it. We face defeat as well as victory in our life. But we should analyze and connect our dots
                (experiences) looking backward. It means that we should learn lessons from our past to step further. He
                was dumped by his girlfriend. He also failed to get job at McKinsey. He wasted his four precious years
                without getting support from anyone. But he became successful at last. It proves that in our life, we
                shouldn&rsquo;t be worried about our failure because one day all the dots will be connected to bring
                something great.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. What happened when Steve Jobs turned 30?<br>
                &#10140; When Steve Jobs turned 30, the board of directors fired him from his own company.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. Jobs contends that you need to love to do what you do in order to be great at it. Do you agree or
                disagree? Why?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, I agree with Jobs&rsquo; statement that we must love what we do to become great. He
                started Apple Company, but he had to leave later. Then he continued with more creative ideas because he
                loved his work. He started NeXT and made it so good that Apple finally bought it.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. Is death really life&rsquo;s greatest invention?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, death is life's greatest invention, death is inevitable and nobody lives forever. Nobody
                wants to die, but everyone shares this intellectual concept. Death is a life-changing factor. To
                overcome this concept, everyone must face this bitter reality.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: &ldquo;We have an unexpected baby
                boy; do you want him?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>
                <br>
                i. Who was the baby boy?<br>
                &#10140; Steve Jobs was the baby boy.<br>
                <br>
                ii. What does &lsquo;do you want him?&rsquo; mean?<br>
                &#10140; 'Do you want him?' It is a question related to the adoption of Steve Jobs to his parents Paul
                and Clara Jobs, who were on the waiting list to adopt the baby.<br>
                <br>
                iii. Who does &lsquo;they&rsquo; refer to?<br>
                &#10140; 'They' refer to Mr. Paul Jobs and Mrs. Clara Jobs.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Explain the following lines:<br>
                i. &ldquo;You have to trust in something &mdash; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.&rdquo;<br>
                &#10140; This line was introduced by Apple Computer CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs in his speech at
                Stanford University. Here he advises everyone to believe and trust these important aspects of their
                life. According to Steve Jobs, these aspects go hand in hand with success. Confidence in these aspects
                can lead anyone to excellence.<br>
                <br>
                ii. &ldquo;Your time is limited, so don&rsquo;t waste it living someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<br>
                &#10140; In the given line, the speaker's opinion is that our life is limited and we shouldn't be
                trapped by other's principle. This can mislead us. We must listen to our own inner voice. We should have
                the courage to follow our heart and intuition. The courage we have can make ourselves what we want to
                be. Everything is secondary.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. What does he mean by &ldquo;don&rsquo;t settle&rdquo;?<br>
                &#10140; Don't settle means we should not accept something which isn't as good as we want it to be. When
                we are terrified of change, failure and taking risks we settle in life. The way to do great work is to
                love what we do. If we don't find it, we should keep look for it. Excellence is a place where people who
                reject to settle for mediocrity lives. It is a journey of continuous progression towards the goals in
                our life.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker adopts a tripartite structure and uses autobiographical anecdotes to communicate a
                message of resilience and personal integrity. The speech is short and simple, and heavily based on
                encouragement.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs&rsquo; speech is so inspiring?<br>
                &#10140; Steve Jobs&rsquo; speech is well crafted as it's emotional, inspiring and simply structured.
                The speech is true and not a feeble. There is a living example standing in front of the audiences. The
                speech emphasizes triumph over adversity. Each of the three stories from Jobs' life involves struggle or
                sacrifice. They help to take listeners to another world, allowing them to put themselves in the
                speaker's shoes. Once they are connected to a speaker, an audience is more likely to follow the
                speaker's advice.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative story telling technique in his speech? What
                influence does it have on the audiences?<br>
                &#10140; I think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative storytelling technique in his speech to motivate
                his audiences. His speech has various facts related to hardships and struggles of life. It has a very
                positive influence on audiences. Through his speech, the audiences have got a chance to know about
                hardships and struggles behind a successful life in real sense.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. One of Steve Jobs mottos was: 'Think differently'. Can this make a person succeed in life? What
                challenges are there in thinking differently?<br>
                &#10140; Yes, it can make a person successful in life. To change the life we have to think and act
                differently. There has to be a change in our thoughts. We have to try to do something different. Similar
                thoughts can never move forward properly. There are different challenges to thinking differently. Many
                legends, inventors, have been humiliated and cut off from societies because they naturally thought
                differently. You should be crazy. Thinking differently can isolate people from majorities, societies,
                etc. We have to think differently for change and development.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. What does the slogan &ldquo;Stay hungry; stay foolish&rdquo; mean to you?<br>
                &#10140; The slogan &quot;Stay hungry; stay foolish&quot; means being ready and willing to try new
                things. We must always strive to know and achieve the important things in our life. We should try to do
                something new in our life with different thoughts.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. What does it mean to be a visionary? What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?<br>
                &#10140; Like Jobs, visionaries have long-term visions and plans. They set the direction of future and
                work hard to get there. Their dream is to change the present situation and make it better. Visionaries
                like Jobs think not only about self but also about society.<br>
                <br>
                Jobs is very different from a fortune teller. People like jobs lead the society with new visions. But
                fortune tellers just tell about about people&rsquo;s life. They have no more role to play for the
                development of society. Progress is the result of dedication of visionaries like Jobs.<br>
