How to live before you die?<br>
<br>
By Shriram Lamichhane<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
Hi everyone, I am Shriram. Talking about the summary of this speech is not very logical since it is a &lsquo;Speech&rsquo; given by Steve Jobs. Hence, Here are some of the inspirational points that we must learn from this speech.<br>
 <br>
I listened to a very inspirational talk by Steve Jobs &rsquo;How to live before you die&lsquo;. By telling 3 stories from his life Steve is urging people to pursue their dreams and trust their intuition.<br>
 <br>
Connecting the dots<br>
Steve always followed his intuition. He never graduated from the university. He didn&rsquo;t know what he wanted to do in his life and didn&rsquo;t think that college would help him figure it out. He dropped out of Reed College just after 6 months. By dropping out he could stop taking the required classes that didn&rsquo;t interest him and join the ones that looked interesting. <br>
<br>
For example he took calligraphy class to learn about typefaces, about what makes great typography great. 10 years later when designing the first Macintosh computer he used his knowledge and skills to design the first computer with beautiful typography.<br>
<br>
 Much of what he stumbled into by following his curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Key learning points:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;You have to trust in something, like your destiny, life, karma, etc. Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even if it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Love and loss<br>
He found what he loved early in life. He started Apple with a friend in his parents&rsquo; garage when he was 20. In 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of them into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. As Apple grew, his visions of the future of Apple began to diverge and he got fired by the Board of Directors. This was a devastating experience for him. What had been the focus of his entire life was gone.<br>
 <br>
He felt rejected, but slowly he began to realize that he still was in love with the work he did. He decided to start over again:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Now he entered one of the most creative periods of his life. During the next 5 years he started a company named NeXT, and then Pixar, which turned out to be the most successful animation studio in the world, creating the world&rsquo;s first computer animated feature film &lsquo;Toy Story&rsquo;.<br>
 <br>
Ironically Apple bought NeXT, and that is how Steve returned to Apple. The technology they developed at NeXT is now &lsquo;at the heart of Apple&rsquo;s current renaissance&rsquo;. Key learning points:<br>
&ldquo;Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don&rsquo;t lose faith.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&rsquo;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&rsquo;t settle. You&rsquo;ll know when you find it. Like any great relationship it gets better and better as the years roll on.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Death<br>
When he was 17, he read this quote: &ldquo;If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you&rsquo;ll most certainly be right.&rdquo;<br>
Since then, he has looked in the mirror every morning and asked himself: &ldquo;If today where the last day of my life, would I want to do what I&rsquo;m about to do today?&rdquo; Whenever the answer has been &ldquo;No&rdquo; for too many days in a row, he knew that something needed to change. Key learning point:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Almost everything, all expectations, pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking that you have something to lose. There&rsquo;s no reason not to follow your heart.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
When he was diagnosed with cancer, at first the doctors told him that he should expect to live no longer than 3-6 months. He lived with that diagnosis for a whole day, until later that evening when he had a biopsy. It turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that was curable. This was the closest he&rsquo;s been to facing death. Key learning points:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Death is the destination that we all share, no one has ever escaped it (&#8230;). Your time is limited, so don&rsquo;t waste it living someone else&rsquo;s life&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be trapped by dogma which is living with the result of other people&rsquo;s thinking. Don&rsquo;t let the noise of others&rsquo; opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
I found Steve&rsquo;s talk very inspiring. I think it&rsquo;s important that we don&rsquo;t forget in our everyday life to follow our passions and that we take the time to often look back at our life to make sure that we do what we love. Otherwise we should keep searching until we find the right path. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be as lucky as Steve!<br>

Understanding the text<br>
<br>
Answer the following Questions<br>
<br>
A. What is the story about Steve Jobs&rsquo; birth?<br>
Ans: His biological mother chose to take him before he was born. She thought that he should be adopted by college graduates and thus everything was for a lawyer and his wife to adopt him at birth. When he was born, at the last minute they decided that they truly wanted a daughter. Later, an illiterate couple adopted him.<br>
<br>
<br>
B. What does he mean when he says, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards&rdquo;?<br>
Ans: Our future is uncertain. Our failure at the present may be the germ of our unfathomable future triumph.<br>
<br>
<br>
c. What happened when Steve Jobs turned 30?<br>
Ans: When Steve Jobs was 30 years old, he was dismissed from the business he founded.<br>
<br>
<br>
D. Jobs contends that you need to love to do what you do in order to be great at it. Do you agree or disagree? Why?<br>
Ans: We trust something we adore. We love to do that with interest. If we are interested in accomplishing things, we succeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
E. Is death really life&rsquo;s greatest invention?<br>
Ans: Yes, death is really the greatest innovation of life. Nobody ever escaped it. It's the agent of transformation in life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference to the context<br>
<br>
A. Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow: &ldquo;We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
i. Who was the baby boy?<br>
<br>
Baby Steve Jobs was the kid.<br>
<br>
ii. What does &lsquo;do you want him?&rsquo; mean?<br>
<br>
The biological mother of Steve Jobs urged his parents to take him on the waiting list.<br>
<br>
iii. Who's referring to 'they'?<br>
<br>
'They' refers to the parents of Steve Jobs on the waiting list.<br>
<br>
<br>
b. Explain the following lines:<br>
<br>
i. &ldquo;You have to trust in something &mdash; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ans. The speaker advises that we believe in ourselves in this phrase. This method enables us to identify our capacity to achieve our objectives. We feel hopeful about the future and driven to accomplish things when we trust ourselves. This creates all our life's distinctions.<br>
<br>
ii. &ldquo;Your time is limited, so don&rsquo;t waste it living someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<br>
Ans. The speaker is of the view that our life is short and that we should not be caught in the principle of others. This can trick us. We have to hear our own inner voice. We should have the bravery to follow our instincts and emotions. The bravery we have is what we desire to be. It's all secondary.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. What does he mean by &ldquo;don&rsquo;t settle&rdquo;?<br>
Ans. Don't settle implies we shouldn't accept anything that we don't want to be as excellent. If we are afraid of change, failure, and risk-taking, we live. The key to perform a good job is to enjoy what we do. We should keep looking for it if we do not locate it. Excellence is a location where individuals refuse to live in mediocrity. It is a voyage of steady development towards our life's objectives.<br>
<br>
d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?<br>
Ans. The speaker utilises a tripartite framework and autobiography to convey a message of perseverance and integrity. The speech is brief, straightforward and strongly motivated.<br>
<br>
e. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs&rsquo; speech is so inspiring?<br>
Ans. Steve Jobs' speech is passionate, inspirational and just structured. The discourse is genuine and not weak. There is a live example before the audience. The speech highlights the victory over hardship. Each of Jobs' three stories includes fighting or sacrificing. They assist to transport listeners to another planet and put them in the speaker's shoes. Once linked to a speaker, the audience will follow the recommendations of the speaker more likely.<br>
<br>
<br>
f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative story telling technique in his speech? What influence does it have on the audiences?<br>
Ans. In his speech Steve Jobs utilised the technical method of personal storytelling to inspire his audience to pursue their dreams. With his own facts, he shows his successful life career. The audiences they didn't know may be courageous with this technique.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reference beyond the text<br>
<br>
A. One of Steve Jobs mottos was: 'Think differently'. Can this make a person succeed in life? What challenges are there in thinking differently?<br>
Ans: A person can achieve in life. We have to think and behave differently in order to alter life. The shift in our thinking must take place. We must attempt to do something else. Similar ideas can never make the right approach to alter life. There are many difficulties in thinking differently. Many stories, inventors, because of their thinking nature, were humiliated and separated from the communities. They should have been crazy. A divergent thought may split individuals apart from majorities, civilizations etc. But we have to think differently for change and growth.<br>
<br>

b. What does the slogan &ldquo;Stay hungry; stay foolish&rdquo; mean to you?<br>
Ans: The phrase &quot;Stay hungry; stay foolish&quot; implies &quot;stay enthusiastic&quot; and &quot;willing to try new things.&quot; We should constantly be enthusiastic to discover significant things in our lives and to accomplish them. We should attempt to accomplish something fresh with various ideas in our lives.<br>
<br>

C. What does it mean to be a visionary? What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?<br>
Ans: Being a visionary implies a good vision or prospect for the future. Steve Jobs is quite different from a teller of fortune. A teller of fortune isn't correct all the time. His forecasts may be wrong. But Steve Jobs' optimistic prediction of the future distinguishes him from that of a fortune teller, as a visionary. Due to his vision in the technological world, he could reach a high level in the technological world. In his foresight there are many important elements including his curiosity, intuition, diverse ways of thinking, hobbies, difficulties and challenges, experience, and faith in his destiny.<br>
