<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>Critical thinking</h3>
<br>
<span>a. What does Mandela mean when he says - a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world?</span>
<br>
<br>
Mandela&rsquo;s expression &lsquo;a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world&rsquo; to means South Africans build such a society where both black and white will be able to walk tall without any fear in their hearts. They also assured of their inalienable right to human dignity. Rainbow is the combination of seven colors. In South Africans cultures, the rainbow symbolizes hope and bright future. 
<br><br>
South Africa is referred to a Rainbow Nation to describe the unity of various cultural, racial or ethnic groups in the country. During the apartheid period, people are divided or separated on the basis of skin color. Mandela wants them to live and work together in unity like the band of colors in a rainbow. He wished they could forget the vicious and repressive past. 
<br><br><br>
<span>b. Mandela should have avenged those who imprisoned him for such a long period. Instead, he followed the path of reconciliation. Why do you think he did so?</span>
<br>
<br>
Mandela led his country wisely and promoted national reconciliation. He was met expectations of supporters around the world. He successfully directed a country at the time of chaos with negotiated settlement. He isn&rsquo;t only encouraged or promoted the development in the abstract but also performed with confidence in reaching out to former opponents. He never avenged on those who imprisoned him, tortured his people and committed horrible atrocities against the non-white populaces in South Africa.
<br><br>
Mandela possessed the capacity of forgiveness. He believed that the feeling of avenge and hate divides the people and creates disorder. A division in a society interrupts harmony among the people. Ruling over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, he sa national reconciliation as the fundamental task of his presidency. Post-colonial African economies were spoiled by the departure of white elites. Mandela assured South Africa&rsquo;s white population that they were protected and represented in South Africa. He made his people believe that prosperity could not be possible without unity. His aim was to liberate all his people from the poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.
<br><br><br>
<span>c. Why and how have societies struggled with segregation in the world? Do you find any evidence of segregation in your society? Discuss.</span>
<br>
<br>

Racial segregation is one of the most common forms of segregation in developed countries. Cast segregation is one of the most common forms of segregation in the Hindu culture.
