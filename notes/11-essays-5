<center>Scientific Research is a Token of Humankindâ€™s Survival</center>
<br>
<h3>Understanding the text</h3> 
<br>
<br>
<span>Answer the following questions.</span>
<br>
<span>a. What does a scientist get instead of big money?</span>
<br>
&#10140; A scientist gets freedom, camaraderie and independence instead of big money.
<br>
<br>
<span>b. What was the problem that the nuclear powers had faced?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The nuclear powers had signed the agreement to stop the test of nuclear weapons. But, they had
faced the problem that if anyone violated the agreement by secret underground testing of nuclear
weapons, how they would detect that test.
<br>
<br>
<span>c. In which area did Keilis Borok's theoretical knowledge have a direct application?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Keilis Borok&rsquo;s knowledge about earthquake had a direct application in the area of nuclear
testing. He had done a research on how the earth shakes during an earthquake. Similar would be the
effect of an underground nuclear explosion. This finding could stop any nuclear tests.
<br>
<br>
<span>d. What was the important decision that the politicians took before Geneva Summit?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Before the Geneva Summit, the politicians of the most powerful countries decided to put a ban

the possibility of nuclear war and save humanity.
<br>
<br>
<span>e. What are the natural and man-made disasters as mentioned by the author?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The natural disasters mentioned by the author are earthquakes, self-inflicted destruction of
megacities, environmental catastrophes, economic and social crises, and so on, whereas man-made
disasters include a massive release of radioactivity from nuclear waste disposal, an outburst of mass
violence, war, and so on.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference to the context</h3> 
<br>
<span>
    a. The professional addressed as &lsquo;you&rsquo; in the sentence &ldquo;If you are clever, why are you
    so poor?&rdquo; refers to a&#8230;
<br>
<i>i. lawyer ii. doctor iii. scientist iv. businessman.</i>
<br>
Justify your choice.</span>
<br>
<br>
&#10140; It refers to a scientist. Scientists are clever and brilliant by their minds. Their earnings
are lesser than other professionals as lawyers, doctors and businessmen. But, they enjoy freedom,
camaraderie and independence. The writer intends to show that although scientists are very wise, their
wisdom does not generally help them in generating wealth. Thus, scientists are generally wise but not
wealthy.

<br>
<br>
<span>b. The writer says, &ldquo;I found myself in Geneva.&rdquo; What does it express?</span>
<br>
&#10140; It expresses the surprise of the writer. He was summoned all of a sudden to attend the meeting
related to nuclear weapons in Geneva. His work was quoted by an American scientist Frank Press while
arguing with Moscow experts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Are the following statements true? Why or why not? Discuss with your partner.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span>i. Money is more powerful than intellectual resources.</span>
<br>
&#10140; This statement is not true. Money is momentary whereas intellectual resources keep on providing
fine results. There isn't any guarantee of money. Money creates a lot of problems. But, intellectual
resources can lead anyone towards success and perfection.
<br>
<br>
<span>ii. Intellectual resources help survival of the mankind.</span>
<br>
&#10140; This statement is true. Intellectual resources are nothing more than hopes for the future of
humanity. Humanity has benefited from intellectual resources in the form of disease relief, terrorism
protection, a healthy lifestyle, and entertainment.
<br>
<br>
<span>iii. Basic research is a way of stalling disasters.</span>
<br>
&#10140; This statement is true. Intellectual resources are only hopes by the help of which mankind is
secured. Due to intellectual resources, mankind has got relief from diseases, safety from terrorism,
healthy life and entertainment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>d. How does the essayist justify that scientific research is the humankind&rsquo;s survival?</span>
<br>
&#10140; By presenting his arguments in favor of science and its research-based inventions, the essayist
argues that scientific research is essential to human survival. Science, he believes, is the unavoidable
guardian and caretaker of humankind's survival. Scientific research ensures the survival of humanity.
Science and its researchers can only find solutions to problems in people's lives. It is science that
can provide us with new energy sources, mineral deposits, medicines, and effective anti-terrorism
defenses. Scientists can easily predict impending disasters and save humanity. It is the only science
that can guarantee that we are moving with time in a safe manner. Thus, the writer has numerous reasons
to believe that scientific research is humanity's best hope for survival.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>e. What can be the purpose of the essayist of using quotations in the essay?</span>

<br>
f. Discuss and illustrate the writer&rsquo;s stand that scientists are the most practical people in the
world
<br>
&#10140; The writer&rsquo;s stand here in this essay is that scientists are the most practical people in
the world. According to him, their practical life could be seen in new technologies, new brands of the
industry from defense to entertainment. The scientists invent antibiotics, electronics, biotechnology,
synthetic fibers, modes of transport, the green revolution, and genetic forensic diagnosis etc. This
proves that scientists are the most practical people.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3> 
<br>
<span>a. Everyone lives under the fear of annihilation by nuclear weapons. Explain this statement.</span>
<br>
&#10140; The essayist is informing all of his readers about the dangerous situation of the cold war in
1960 in this line. It was a terrifying situation. The superpowers, such as the Soviet Union, the United
States, and the United Kingdom, had more than enough nuclear bombs to destroy the other countries in a
single strike. As a result, every man, woman, and child on the planet lived under the threat of nuclear
annihilation. These superpowers were willing to reach an agreement in order to deal with this
threat.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    b. The essayist says &lsquo;While there is science, there is hope of survival and wellbeing for all of
    us.&rsquo; Explain it.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; According to the essayist, science is our unavoidable guardian and caretaker because it is the
only science capable of ensuring that we move with time safely. Countries had signed a treaty to refrain
from secretly testing nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity's survival. Countries had signed a treaty
to refrain from secretly testing nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity's survival. However, science
and its scientists ensured the survival of humanity. It is the only science capable of distinguishing
between tremors caused by nuclear explosions and natural earthquakes. It is the science that can provide
us with new energy sources, mineral deposits, and effective anti-terrorism defenses. Science's hope for
humanity's survival has a broader significance as well. In the current scenario, both natural and
man-made disasters endanger humanity's safety. Whether it is a tsunami or terrorism, money alone will
not solve the problem. The only hope is for scientific solutions. Thus, the author has a numerous
reasons to conclude that science is the only hope for survival.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Is science a blessing or a curse? Write an essay on it</span>
<br>
&#10140; Science is the search and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social
world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. Scientists experiment with various new
things related to this world as well as life. Science can be regarded as both a blessing and a curse.
The most important aspect of science is its application. Science has done various tasks for the welfare
of mankind whereas it has even brought various negative impacts against mankind in this world. The
scientists invent antibiotics, electronics, biotechnology, synthetic fibers, the green revolution, and
genetic forensic diagnosis etc. All these inventions have brought development in humans' lives. The
basic knowledge of science always supports people in their lives. Due to science and its inventions,
most people are dying out in the present time too. Different kinds of weapons are the outcomes of
science itself. Science shouldn't be used against humanity. It should be used for the welfare of
humanity. Thus, science should be used humanly without any bad intentions.
