<br><br>
<span>a. What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in power for long in a country? Discuss.</span>
<br>
There are many successful political leaders in the world, but only a handful live up to the leadership principles. Many political leaders, in reality, lack the most critical leadership characteristics. History &ndash; and current events &ndash; demonstrate that there are still a few who adhere to leadership principles and serve as excellent models of effective political leaders.
<br>
Characteristics of a good political leader include accountability, Honesty, Compassion, Integrity, Flexibility, Confidence etc.
<br><br>
 
<br>
<span>b. The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal? Explain.</span>
<br><br>
Nepal is still immature in terms of practicing democracy. Though the constitution ensures the idea of collective-decision making which lets all the people participate equally, isn&rsquo;t practically applied. In the present contact, the political system Abraham Lincoln imagined isn&rsquo;t applicable in Nepal as corruption, paralyzed constitutional and governmental institutions, illiteracy and poverty are the major threats to it.
<br><br>
Democratic norms and values depend on the proper function of constitutions organs and governmental institutions. They have been crippled by a certain group of people. The role of bureaucracy is important to run the administration smoothly so that the development strategies could be easily executed. But the corrupt bureaucracy don&rsquo;t do their jobs without bribe and they are supported by the political leaders. Nepalese people have never experienced a responsible, accountable government. The government institutions have been the victims of nepotism and favoritism.
<br><br>
Illiteracy and poverty are long standing problems in our country. Recent data reveals that Nepal is improving its literacy rate. However, the remarkable population is illiterate. They are more likely to follow the crowd and get on bandwagon. Due to this incapability, they can be easily influenced by the political leaders. Ultimately, the leaders are able to hold the power and misuse it. On the other hand, people&rsquo;s hunger presents an opportunity for opportunist parties to exploit poor people&rsquo;s political freedom. They offer monetary help or promise to uplift the standard of living in exchange for a vote. The election then goes to the hand of such leaders.
<br><br>
Even developed countries are facing the challenges for the application of democratic principles. In the countries like Nepal, it has been more difficult for institutionalization of democracy. To strengthen democratic principles, all the constitutional bodies, government institutions and citizens should be responsible.
