    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in power for long in a country?
        Discuss.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Leadership refers to the quality of leading people. Probably, it is one of the most important aspects of life. Above
    all, Leadership by a good leader has led to the progress of human civilization. Without a good leader, no
    organization or group can succeed. Furthermore, not everyone has this quality. This is because effective Leadership
    requires certain important characteristics.
    <br><br>
    First of all, confidence is the most quality. A leader must have strong self-confidence. A person lacking in
    confidence can never be a good leader. A person must be confident enough to ensure others follow him. A good leader
    must certainly inspire others. A leader must be a role model for his followers. Furthermore, he must
    motivate them whenever possible. Also, in difficult situations, a leader must not lose hope. Honesty is another
    notable quality of a leader. Honesty and Integrity are important to earn the love of followers. Probably, every
    Leadership which loses trust is
    bound to fail. People will not work with full effort due to an immoral leader.
    Another important quality is good communication and decision making. Above all, if a leader makes poor
    communications and poor decisions then other qualities will not matter. Furthermore, good decision making ensures
    the success of the entire group. If the leader makes poor
    decisions, then the efforts of followers won’t matter.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, a good leader must be an excellent innovator. He must display a creative attitude in his work. Most
    noteworthy,
    innovation is a guarantee of survival of a group or innovation. Without creative thinking, progress is not possible.
    <br><br>
    If a leader is good, capable and have all the above traits then he/she can easily remain in power for long in a
    country.

    <span>b. The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people
        and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal? Explain.</span>
    <br><br>
    The literal meaning of `democracy' is `rule by the people', or, in other words, a political system in which ultimate
    authority is shared equally by all members of the community. In Nepal as elsewhere such a system is widely endorsed
    as a desirable state of affairs but there is no precise, shared understanding of what it implies in practice. In
    Nepal, even more than in most other places, there is also a sense of deep disillusionment with what a system
    describing itself as democratic has actually achieved.
    <br><br>
    The political system presented by
    Abraham Lincoln does not apply to Nepal, as corruption had paralyzed constitutional and government agencies. The
    Constitution guarantees the idea of ​​collective
    decision-making that includes all people equally, but it does not actually apply.
    Democratic norms and values ​​depend on the proper functioning of constitutional and state institutions. But it has
    been
    crippled by a group of certain people. The role of bureaucrats is important to keep the administration running
    smoothly so that development strategies can be easily implemented. However, corrupt bureaucracy does not do its job
    without bribes and is endorsed by political leaders. Nepalese people have never experienced a
    responsible, accountable government. State institutions are victims of nepotism and discrimination.
    Thus, in a country like Nepal,
    institutionalizing democracy is more difficult. To strengthen the principles of democracy, all constitutional
    agencies, government agencies and citizens must be responsible.

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Write an essay on Power and Politics in about 500 words.</span>
    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Power and Politics</p>
    <br>
    Power is usually defined as the ability to influence people’s behavior by getting people to do what the person
    wants. Politically, having the ability to influence people is a huge responsibility. Being a leader means having the
    abilities to not only convince people, but also to inspire them and influence their decision by making them see the
    sense that the person with power is acting in their best interest. Therefore, political power is about not only
    persuasion, but also manipulation. Politics is the act of persuasion, acquisition, and exercise of political power.
    <br><br>

    Political power shapes and control people’s attitude towards the leader and the governing system. The leader guides
    the behavior of his followers in a direction he desires to achieve the common political objectives. Occupying a
    political position means having the power and the ability to effect the desired change of behavior of other people
    involved through persuasion or manipulation. For example, if an individual has the political power over the other
    person, the degree in which a leader can motivate, incite, inspire, stimulate, and makes other people modify their
    political behavior. This process is termed as having the political power.
    <br><br>

    Illegitimate political power implies exercising powers that violate the existing rules; these may include sabotage,
    protests, and whistle blowing. Extreme illegitimate forms of political power pose a risk of loss of membership.
    Since most political organization is made up of individuals with different values and interest, this presents the
    potential for conflict over resources. A leader in power uses his position to attain group goals. However, power is
    applied in different forms. Coercive power is based on fear. Coercive power includes sanctions, restrictions, and
    control by force.
    <br><br>

    Power plays an important role in politics because its consequences can yield positive or negative results. Power in
    politics is a two-way relationship depending on how people interact based on the resources or values they hold or
    are in control of. Conflict arises due to pressure to achieve specific goals that might not be realistic. That is
    why leaders manipulate his followers to serve their needs at the expense of others. In a democratic system, use of
    power should not involve force; instead of obtaining power should be more of influence that is known as soft power.

    <span>b. Write a couple of paragraphs about a national hero who fought bravely in the Anglo-Nepal War.</span>
    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Balbhadra Kunwar Chhetri</p>
    <br>
    Balbhadra Kunwar Chhetri (30 January 1789 – 13 March 1823) was a Nepalese military commander and administrator in the Kingdom of Nepal. He is one of the National heroes of Nepal. He was highly praised for his military skill for the defence of the Nalapani fort in the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–1816). He was Captain in the Nepalese military and was tasked as commander to protect the forts of Dehradun.
    <br><br>
    As commander of the Gorkhali forces in Dheradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar was handed the responsibility of defending the area. The expanding Nepali/Gorkhali State had since the mid-late 18th century expanded the nation's border on all sides, which eventually led to conflict with the British East India Company and a war followed. Realizing he could not defend the town of Dehradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar withdrew to the strategic hill fort of Khalanga with an army strength of 600 including women and children against the British East India Company British stronghold of 3000–3500 troops. He turned down an incentive proposal of the British who would make him Governor of the Western Garhwal should he surrender or leave Nepal.
