    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why did millions of Palestinians leave their country?</span>
    <br>
    Millions of Palestinians left their country because in their country, they were denied basic human rights to find a

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How is the global culture formed? Is cultural identity possible even in the global culture? Justify.</span>
    <br>
    The global culture is formed by the youthful generations who have grown up in the midst of massive technological
    advancements. Even in a global society, cultural identity is conceivable. Social media, street journalism, and
    global transnational businesses all play a role in catalysing new global culture formation processes. Globalization
    fosters cultural identity by creating a feeling of belonging. People are becoming increasingly worried about the
    uniqueness and particularity of their own culture in the current age of globalisation. Cultural identity gives local
    knowledge worldwide importance as well as a feeling of self, community, and country.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Why can moving from one side of the world to the other be an economic challenge for newcomers?</span>
    <br>
    Moving from one side of the world to the other can be an economic challenge for newcomers because integration
    programme needs time; starting from learning the language, integrating culturally, integration into the labour
    market.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. How can immigrants foster economy at different magnitudes of scale in their new homes?</span>
    <br>
    Immigrants ca foster economy at different magnitudes of scale in their new homes by starting their own businesses.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. Can immigrants fully integrate in the new societies? Give reasons.</span>
    <br>
    No, immigrants can't fully integrate in the new societies because they are unwilling to be part of the new society
    and the society does not open its doors fully to allow them to integrate.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>f. Mention any two benefits of integrating into a new society for the immigrants.</span>
    <br>
    - Migrants will have equal learning, engagement, and self-esteem possibilities. After that, they may serve as a
    strong bridge for mutual understanding between the two cultures or faiths.
    <br>
    - Wherever immigrants come from, the receiving nations will improve their economic prospects.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>g. Why should the immigrants run in concordance with global culture?</span>
    <br>
    The immigrants should run in concordance with global culture because of the following reasons:
    <br>
    - The cost of isolation and non-convergence is higher and more damaging than integration.
    <br>
    - They can face the fear of losing identity.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <br>
    <span>a. Do you think that the local is globalized and the global is localized? Can there be the global culture as well? Give examples.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Globalization tends to emphasize similarities, whereas local emphasizes difference. The relationship between the
    individual and the group is dynamic in that both depend upon and interact with each other. The cultural context in which this occurs is what distinguished societies from one another.
    <br>
    <br>
    Localizing your materials involves making necessary changes to existing content to ensure that an local people will understand it. Globalization is the development of product that is easily accepted worldwide.
    <br>
    <br>
    Yes there can be the global culture as well. Some examples are listed below:
    <br>
    1. Creating a more homogenous world.
    <br>
    2. Attempt to promote a Western lifestyle and possibly Americanize the world.
    <br>
    3. Trend that will eventually make all of human experience and customs the same since all cultures are coming together into one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. What is globalization? Discuss the effects of globalization on traditional cultures.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. Globalization has accelerated due to advances in transportation and communication technology. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that is associated with social and cultural aspects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The effects of globalization on traditional cultures are as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>i. The Negative Effects of Globalization on Cultural Loss</b>
    <br>
    Apart from all the benefits globalization has had on allowing cultural exchanges it also homogenized the
    world&rsquo;s cultures. That&rsquo;s why specific cultural characteristics from some countries are disappearing.
    From languages to traditions or even specific industries. That&rsquo;s why according to UNESCO, the mix between the
    benefits of globalization and the protection of local culture&rsquo;s uniqueness requires a careful approach.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ii. The Economic Negative Effects of Globalization</b>
    <br>
    Despite its benefits, the economic growth driven by globalization hasn&rsquo;t been done without awakening
    criticism. The consequences of globalization are far from homogenous: income inequalities, disproportional wealth
    and trades that benefit parties differently. In the end, one of the criticisms is that some actors benefit more from
    the phenomena of globalization, while others are sometimes perceived as the &ldquo;losers&rdquo; of globalization.
    As a matter of fact, a recent report from Oxfam says that 82% of the world&rsquo;s generated wealth goes to 1% of
    the population.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. Discuss the impacts of globalization on the process and progress of education in Nepal.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Globalization has a close relation with education. As education has an important place in shaping a society, globalization has to be connected with education and the global activities have a deep impact on it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Globalization has had many obvious effects on the process and progress of education in Nepal. The global communication systems change the way education is delivered as well as roles played by both teachers and students. The development of this technology is facilitating the transition from an industrial based society to an information-based one. At the same time, there is a dark side to globalization and to the very openness of the new information systems; while the richest countries grow richer, the poor are becoming poorer. Thus, information and education gaps between the rich and the poor are widening not narrowing; economic crises, trade imbalances and structural adjustments have caused a moral crisis in many countries like Nepal, damaging and cutting the basic social and cultural fabric of many families and communities apart, resulting in increasing youth unemployment, suicide, violence, racism and drug abuse and antisocial behaviour form schools.
