    <center>An Astrologerâ€™s Day</center>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <br>
    The short story &lsquo;An Astrologer&rsquo;s Day&rsquo; by R. K. Narayan is a thriller and suspense
    short story which deals with a single day in the life of an ordinary astrologer who shrewdly tries to
    dupe people and escape from his guilt. The story not only exposes the fake astrologer but also
    highlights the gullible and superstitious people who approach him. His day begins like any other day but
    the day ends with unexpected events. When he is about to wind up his business, he meets a rogue
    character, Guru Nayak who is a part of the past life of the astrologer. Towards the end, as readers, we
    receive a shock that Guru Nayak and the astrologer belong to the same native towns. They were once upon
    a time good friends and had a quarrel one day. The result was that both were into bad company and had a
    fight. The astrologer tried to kill Guru Nayak by attacking him with a knife and when Guru Nayak
    fainted, he threw him into a nearby well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, a passerby saved Guru Nayak. The astrologer left his native village forever and became an
    astrologer. Thus suddenly he confronts his past unexpectedly but smartly tackles the situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    The surrounding darkness seems to offer a refuge to the astrologer. There is an unexpected twist in the
    tale with the arrival of Guru Nayak on the scene. Gradually the mystery that is hidden in the darkness
    is unveiled by his questions. Guru Nayak challenges the astrologer&rsquo;s knowledge. He refuses to go
    away without getting a satisfactory answer to his questions.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, the astrologer who is at his wit&rsquo;s end now decides to face the situation. He displays
    accurate knowledge about Guru Nayak&rsquo;s past and is successful in convincing him. In answering the
    question of Guru Nayak, the astrologer has not only deceived him but also saved himself from his own
    fate. The author superbly evokes the atmosphere of suspense and irony in the story. The story reveals
    how appearances are often deceptive. It shows the witty astrologer&rsquo;s encounter and escape from his
    former enemy.

    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. How does the astrologer&rsquo;s appearance help him attract customers? How does he help the customers
        satisfy their needs?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The astrologer&rsquo;s long mustache and beard, a turban round his head, and ash and vermilion
    on his forehead give him the appearance of a true astrologer and helps him attract customers. He
    satisfies the needs of the customers by telling them those things which please and astonish them and by
    the working analysis of their troubles like marriage, money, and tangles of their relationship.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>b. How do you characterize the astrologer&rsquo;s attitude toward the stranger?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The astrologer sees the stranger before him and perceives him to be his possible customer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>c. What details does the astrologer give the stranger about his past?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The astrologer tells the astrologer that he was stabbed by a knife and thrown into a well to
    die, and some passers-by saw him and saved from dying.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>d. Why does he advise the stranger to go home immediately?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The astrologer advises the stranger to take the next train and go home immediately or else a
    great danger is sure to fall in his life again. In reality, the astrologer advises so as he does not
    want his identity to be discovered by the stranger Guru Nayak.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>e. What is your reaction to the conversation between the astrologer and his wife?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Previously I was shocked while reading the conversation between the astrologer and Guru Nayak.
    I could not understand how the astrologer knew everything about Guru Nayak&rsquo;s past including his
    name. But after reading the conversation between the astrologer and his wife, the suspense was revealed
    behind the astrologer&rsquo;s information about Guru Nayak as it was clarified that the astrologer was
    the person himself who had tried to kill Guru Nayak in the past under the effect of alcohol.
    <br>

    various facts of his life during his prophecies, he tells exactly his past events, his name and address,
    and it is precisely these details that made me feel surprised. The stranger is too excited and
    satisfied, but I feel a kind of suspense. One question arises in my mind: &quot;How did he answer
    accurately?&quot; This particular suspense surprises when the astrologer tells his wife the details of
    his past after dinner. Here I find the answer to my feeling of suspense. The details of the astrologer's

    to please him. He is surprised when the astrologer tells him about his past life and agrees to stop
    looking for his enemy who would have been knocked down under a truck. The astrologer guarantees a safe

    in a densely populated urban environment by using his intelligence. The astrologer lives by his wits.
    Despite having no mystical knowledge he knows how to put on a show to attract passers-by. It is obvious
    that he must sit for long hours in order to collect enough to keep himself and his family alive from day
    to day. In addition to his intelligence, he is courageous and determined. When he is dealing with Guru
    Nayak and his life is in danger, he still insists on bargaining for money. He brings every single anna
    home to his wife so that she can buy food for the family. He is a devoted husband and father.
    <br>
    <br>
    The story has the mode of third-person omniscience. The use of dialogue throughout the story serves the
    function of providing multiple points of view without changing the overall authority of the narrator.
    The story is set in the Town Hall Park, in the late evening. The reader learns that the astrologer is
    usually under the tamarind tree by noon.
    <br>
    <br>

        e. Irony is a contrast between appearances and reality. What is ironic about Guru Nayak&rsquo;s meeting
        with the astrologer?
    </span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The meeting of Guru Nayak and the astrologer seems quite ironic. Here we find Guru Nayak, who
    asks the astrologer about the perpetrator who once stabbed him in the chest with a knife. He doesn't
    know that the culprit is the astrologer. The darkness and the astrologer rise, Guru Nayak cannot
    recognize him. The lifelong burden for the astrologer is the murder of Guru Nayak. He is quite surprised
    to find Guru Nayak alive. The information from the perpetrator makes Guru Nayak feel satisfied. The
    astrologer's ruse is very ironic. Here the victim turns to the perpetrator to find the right solution.
    Finally, Guru Nayak feels good to hear the prophecies of the (guilty) astrologer. Here both characters
    finally feel good.
    <br>
    <br>
