    <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
    <br><br>
    <span>Answer the following questions.</span>
    <br>
    <span>a. Why does Wasserkopf demand a refund of his tuition fees from the school?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Wasserkopf demands a refund of his tuition fees from the school because he claims that he didn’t learn anything from the school and his 18 years education made him nothing but an incompetent ass.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>b. Why does Wasserkopf consider himself good for nothing?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Wasserkopf considers himself good for nothing because his school taught him nothing and he becomes failure many times in his life in the matter of getting a job too.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. What did the teachers decide to do when Wasserkopf asked for a refund?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The teachers approved Wasserkopf's request for a re-examination and pass him in all subjects, even if his answers were incorrect. They agreed to prove Wasserkopf's answers to their questions correct.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>d. Why did Wasserkopf give ridiculous answers? Why did the teachers accept these answers?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Wasserkopf gave ridiculous answers so that he could fail the exam by any means necessary and receive a refund. Teachers accepted his answers because they wanted him to pass the exam to preserve the school's reputation.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. How does the Mathematics Master describe Wasserkopf&rsquo;s character?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; The Mathematics Master describe Wasserkopf’s character as a sly and crafty individual who intends to deliberately fail his exam in order to recoup his tuition fee. He is a unique individual who irritates all of the teachers with his abusive language.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>f. How did the teachers outwit Wasserkopf?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140;  He gave wrong and ridiculous answers to fail the test. But the teachers were cleverer than him. After asking Wasserkopf the easy question, the mathematics teacher said that he failed the exam and asked him to calculate the amount the school had to refund. He did it very well. The mathematics teachers said that he solved the difficult question as he was a mathematical genius. The teachers declared that he passed the exam. In this way, they outwitted Wasserkopf.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>g. What is the final judgment on Waserkopf&rsquo;s demand of refund?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; At last, he gets nothing on his demand of refund. The principal declares that Wasserkopf has passed the re-examination with distinction in every subject, and has again shown that he is entitled to the certificate they awarded him on his graduation.
    <br><br><br><br><br>

    <br><br>

    <br>
    <i>
        &ldquo;THE STAFF: (bowing, heartily) How do you do?
        <br>
        WASSERKOPF: Who the hell are you? Sit down, you loafers! (He grins, waiting to be thrown out)
        <br>
        THE PRINCIPAL: How dare you &ndash;&rdquo;
    </i>
    <br><br>
    <span>i. What is to be the response to &lsquo;How do you do?&rsquo;</span>

    <span>ii. Is Wasserkopf&rsquo;s response polite enough to the staff?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; No, Wasserkopf's response to the staff isn't polite enough. He uses derogatory language against
    them.
    <br><br>
    <span>iii. How does Wasserkopf rebuke the staff?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Wasserkopf rebukes the staff, calling them &quot;loafers&quot; and asking, &quot;Who the hell
    are you?&quot;
    <br><br>
    <span>iv. What does the principal mean by &lsquo;How dare you -&rsquo;?</span>
    <br>

    says, 'How dare you?'
    <br><br><br>
    <span>c. Explain the following line of the play:</span>
    <br>
    <i>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t get my money&rsquo;s worth, that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</i>
    <br>
    &#10140; This line was spoken by Wasserkopf, the play's main character. In this line, Wasserkopf explains his reason for his arrival and demand a refund to the school's principal. According to him, his education from school did not provide him anthying. He is fired from the job and is in financial crisis. Wasserkoph is, therefore, justified in claiming for a refund. He adds that a reexamination will prove that his demand is valid.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>d. What is the theme of the play?</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; This play is a satire on today's educational system, which has failed to prepare students for life. This play showcases teachers' wit and unity in the face of an ill-natured old pupil Wasserkopf who returns to his old school with an absurd demand.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>e. Sketch the character of Wasserkopf.</span>
    <br>
    &#10140; Wasserkopf is a forty-year-old poor and greedy man. He was born in Hungary. He is a bad-tempered man who has been fired several times for his bad manners and rude behaviour. Wasserkopf seems to be the type of person who does not do his duty and blames others. While at school, he just wanted to pass and did not study well. He does not even know about foreign exchange. That is why he did not get a good job. He himself says he is good for nothing. Wasserkopf also sounds like an undisciplined man with no good manners. He does not respect the teachers. He uses bad words to describe them. He thinks he is clever enough to get the refund. But he is greedy and stupid and falls in their trap.

    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <br>
    <span>
        a. The play is a satire on the present day education system. Do you think that our education system does
        not prepare students for life? Discuss.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; Yes, I believe that our educational system does not adequately prepare students for life. I think that our education system does not prepare students for life. Our education system is based on memorization. Students hardly learn skills useful for real life. But today’s students also do not care about real knowledge. They just want to pass the exams. Theoretical and rot learning are still prevalent in different parts of the world like Nepal. It only focuses on text and exam. Our curriculum doesn’t prepare us for our future struggle and survival. For example, we learn but we can’t apply all mathematical rules in our real life. It changes students dull and less creative in practical life. They never learn life-skills. So, education system must focus on practical knowledge to improve our life.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>
        b. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the
        knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one&rsquo;s day-to-day life? Who do
        you blame for this?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; Yes, I believe that the knowledge imparted by education may not be practical in daily life. I think that our government is responsible for the cause. Our government should make curriculum more practical than theoretical. It should be useful in our life. Our education system is more based on memorization then on learning the skills useful for real life. Students too are responsible for this.  Today’s students also do not care about real knowledge. They just want to pass the exams. Theoretical and rot learning are still prevalent in different parts of the world like Nepal. It only focuses on text and exam. Our curriculum doesn’t prepare us for our future struggle and survival. For example, we learn but we can’t apply all mathematical rules in our real life. It changes students dull and less creative in practical life. They never learn life-skills. So, education system must focus on practical knowledge to improve our life.
    <br><br><br>
    <span>
        c. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that
        certificate will help them in their future career?
    </span>
    <br><br>
    &#10140; It is true that most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. They want to get higher marks only by hook or crook. But that certificate won’t help them in their future career. Theoretical knowledge focuses on text books which aren’t practicable in our real life. It is only increasing unemployment rate in Nepal day by day. Every year 5ooooo people enter job market but only about 100000 people became able to get job. One of the cause behind increasing unemployment in Nepal is useless focus on theoretical curriculum. Many certificate holders don’t get proper job due to insufficient skill. Most of the migrated students also forced to do manual jobs in foreign countries although they have degree from Nepal. It proves that certificate can’t ensure our future. We need more practical syllabus to maintain our position in changing global scenario.
