                Notes by: Subarna Poudel
                <br>
                <br>


                Understanding the text <br>
                <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. How does the writer distinguish between a peaceful age and a heroic age?<br>
                &#10140; The writer distinguishes between a peaceful age and a heroic age by making a comparison between
                two different ages. He refers to the time of his birth as a peaceful age whereas his youth age as a
                heroic age. During his youth age (aged 22), the first world war broke out. He desired to live his
                peaceful age but engaged himself in a heroic age of war.<br>
                <br>
                b. Why does the writer want more freedom of speech than most people?<br>
                &#10140; The writer wants more freedom than other people to point out what is wrong in society. He sees
                that medicines, newspapers and drinks do not maintain quality. He wants freedom of speech to tell the
                public about such issues.<br>
                <br>
                c. According to the writer, what are the four general human needs?<br>
                &#10140; According to the writer the four general human needs are work, freedom of speech, health and
                friendship.<br>
                <br>
                d. What is the difference between desire and demand according to the writer?<br>
                &#10140; Demand is related with the basic needs of life like food, clothes and shelter. But desire
                includes things which improve living standard. We can do without them. The writer talks about car,
                garden, bathing pool and nearby beach as desires.<br>
                <br>
                e. Why does the writer demand security?<br>
                &#10140; The writer demands security because it is also an important need for a happy life. It is the
                right of everyone. He lived in the age of war and saw the destruction. Armies may be involved in war,
                but common people need security.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                Explain the following lines with reference to the context:<br>
                a. &ldquo;The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.&rdquo;<br>
                &#10140; The author believes that adventure is not only about emotions, but also about satisfaction in
                performing a creative activity. He served on the war front in Madrid for six months and looked forward
                to reading a book of Rimbaud's poetry for a thrill.<br>
                <br>
                b. &ldquo;I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their
                own and their friends&rsquo; well-being.&rdquo;<br>
                &#10140; Here in this line, the author, as a socialist, wants the workers to exercise the fruits of
                their labour so as not to enrich the bourgeois capitalists but to benefit from the wages of the workers
                themselves for their own economic prosperity.<br>
                <br>
                c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?<br>
                &#10140; The essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle to
                support his ideas. He uses reference of Aristotle to support his idea of decent work. In the same way,
                he brings reference of Socrates to support his idea of death.<br>
                <br>
                d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of writing.<br>
                &#10140; The writer has used very simple and clear language to present his ideas on socialism. His
                purpose is to demand equality and democratic activities for all working class people in their working
                places. He is against capitalism which doesn&rsquo;t favor the need of working class people. According
                to him, capitalism is the main cause behind growing unemployment. The writer uses socialist point of
                view to support his ideas. He uses descriptive style to persuade his ideas.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text<br>
                a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?<br>
                &#10140; To be happy and satisfied, I require good health, a job, friendship, freedom &amp; security
                from my life.<br>
                <br>
                b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?<br>
                &#10140; Socialism is a system of social and economic equality in which private property and ownership
                are not prioritized. It differs from capitalism because capitalism does not provide economic equality.
                Capitalism, unlike socialism, ignores people's needs and does not promote equal opportunity.<br>
                <br>
                c. Write an essay about your dream house.<br>
                &#10140; My Dream House<br>
                My dream house is an ideal house that I always imagine. House becomes home when we pour love to our
                family members. It is a place where different generation live together in a single bond. So, my dream
                house will be full of love and happiness.<br>
                <br>
                My dream house will be in Ilam&rsquo;s hill. It will be surrounded by tea estates. When I will wake up
                in the morning, I will enjoy the clean environment of the surroundings. My dream house will be made up
                wood, cement and zinc. There will be 6 rooms in my house. It should be facing East direction because I
                want to enjoy cool air as well as rising sun view. I will make small vegetable as well as fruit garden
                where I will grow fresh vegetables and fruits for my family. I would like to avoid harmful vegetables
                from market. I would like to maintain my house neat and clean. There will be a meditation room for
                myself to do Yoga and meditation. I will also make one library room for my family and visitors. I will
                make a special room for my parents and visitors because I believe in the motto &ldquo;Helping others is
                as equal as praying gods&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t add too much amenities in my dream house because it
                creates laziness. I believe that physical exercises are necessary to be healthy and fit. There will be
                solar panel in my house to maintain regular light. I will also add a big smart TV for my parents and
                visitors. My house&rsquo;s wall will be decorated with beautiful wall paintings capturing nature&rsquo;s
                true beauty.<br>
                <br>
                My dream home is a place of joy, peace and beauty. Right now it exists only in my dreams. But someday,
                it will become a reality.<br>
