    <center>The Gift in Wartime</center>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
The first stanza opens with speaker offering roses and a wedding gown in her husband&rsquo;s grave. In
the second stanza, he gives the speaker medals, silver stars, and a badge. These items seem to be less
meaningful and personal than the items that the speaker offers.
<br>
<br>
The pattern &lsquo;the speaker offers much more than her husband&rsquo; continues throughout the poem,
except in the final stanza. In the third stanza, the speaker offers him her youth. The fourth stanza
reveals that her husband gives her the smell of blood. For the speaker her husband&rsquo;s offerings are
insignificant to her.
<br>
<br>
In the fifth stanza, the speaker gives him clouds of summer. She sacrifices her cold winters and
springs. In the sixth stanza, it is mentioned that her husband remains unmoved by these offerings. In
return he gives the speaker lips with no smile, arms without tenderness and eyes with no sight as he is
dead.
<br>
<br>
In the final stanza, the speaker deeply apologizes to her husband about her complain regarding his
offerings. The speaker promises to meet him in their next life. She will keep the shrapnel as a token,
which will help them know and recognize each other in next life.
<br>

dead.
<br>
<br>
<span>

    &ldquo;you&rdquo;?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; Her feelings for that person she addresses as “you” is full of love, affection and devotion. She has gifted him all the pleasures of life. She is saddened by his death. Although he is no more in the world, she is still hopeful to meet him in their next life.
<br>
<br>

<br>
&#10140; The speaker complains against war. Her feelings show the tragedy caused by war. It killed her dear husband and spoiled her life. Her happiness and youth ended with his death. Now there is only sadness. There is no compensation for her loss. She has presented various negative aspects of the war in her poem.
<br>
<br>
<span>d. In what ways do you think this person&rsquo;s fate has affected the speaker?</span>
<br>
&#10140; This person’s fate was to die in war because he was a soldier. The speaker feels her happiness and youth ended with his death. Her life is changed from spring to winter. There are no smiles and hugs from him. There is only sadness for her. Thus, the ill-fate of the person has made her helpless, loveless and miserable.
<br>
<br>

<br>
&#10140; At the end of the poem, the speaker promises to meet her lovable person in their next life.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Reference to the context</h3> 
<br>
<span>a. What is the theme of the poem?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The theme of the poem is the cruelty and inhumanity of the war and its negative impacts over humans. The poem talks about the tragedy caused by war. One life ends but many others are affected. After the untimely death of the soldier, his family and dear ones will suffer. Life is priceless, so there is no compensation for this great loss.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you? Why?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The poet has used several powerful images in this poem. Among them all, I liked the shrapnel image the most. It made it very clear what gift a war can give to human beings. The shrapnel does not only mean that it shattered the body of the soldier, but also shattered the life of the beloved. That is the deadly gift of the war.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.</span>
<br>
&#10140; Figurative language is phrasing that the goes beyond the literal meaning of words to get a message. We find the use of irony, apostrophe, anaphora, and metaphor as the figurative language here in this poem. 
<br><br>
Irony takes place when the poet talks about the gift which is not a real gift but of grief and loss. A grave and shrapnel as tokens of remembrance are not the types of gifts people truly want.
<br><br>
The poet uses imagery when roses are offered in her beloved's grave, and her husband is described as as a corpse with lips with no smile and eyes with no sight. The red roses traditionally symbolize love.
<br><br>
The next figure of speech includes anaphora, which is the repetition of the same words at the beginning of a line. In the first, third and fifth stanzas, the poet repeats "I offer you". The anaphora comes in the sixth stanza when the speaker repeats "you give me" three times in a row.
<br><br>
The poem also uses the method of apostrophe, which is direct address to a person who is not present or to an inanimate object. The poet makes use of metaphor as she compares her sadness to the clouds in her eyes on a summer day.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    d. What does the speaker &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in this poem? What does the person addressed as
    &ldquo;you&rdquo; give in return?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; The speaker offers various things in this poem to her lovable person. She offers roses, her wedding gown, her youth, clouds, cold winters etc. The person addressed as "you" gives her the medals with shining stars, badge with yellow pips, the smell of blood from wardress, lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight, body without motion etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an
    abstract idea in such a way as if it were present and can understand. Discuss the poem in relation to
    apostrophe.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an abstract idea in such a way as if it were present and can understand. She addresses her dead husband by using an apostrophe. The speaker is talking to her husband who was killed in war. She offers him red roses and her wedding gown at his grave. Her youth has ended with his death. His badge, bravery medals and the blood from his dress make her sad. Her eyes are full like summer clouds. Her life is changed from spring to winter. She wants to prove her deep love and respect for her husband by showing her sacrifice. Hence, this poem has shown the bitter reality of war on humans through the speaker's dialogues for her absent lovable person using the apostrophe.

    in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did? Explain.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. Grief is caused by loss. In emotional situation a person can get relief by talking with dear one. We can share our pain to other by writing poem, stories, etc. or sharing our experiences with other. The speaker in this poem has also chosen the same path.

<span>b. Write an essay on the effects of war.</span>
<br>
&#10140; 
<br>
<center><b>Effects of War</b></center>
<br>
The effects of war are widely spread and can be long term or short term. Soldiers experience war differently than civilians, although either suffer in times of war, and women and children suffer unspeakable atrocities in particular. In the past decade, up to two million of those killed in armed conflicts were children. The widespread trauma caused by these atrocities and suffering of the civilian population is another legacy of these conflicts, the following creates extensive emotional and psychological stress. Present-day internal wars generally take a larger toll on civilians than state wars. This is due to the increasing trend where combatants have made targeting civilians a strategic objective. A state conflict is an armed conflict that occurs with the use of armed force between two parties, of which one is the government of a state. "The three problems posed by intra‐state conflict are the willingness of UN members, particularly the strongest member, to intervene; the structural ability of the UN to respond; and whether the traditional principles of peacekeeping should be applied to intra‐state conflict". Effects of war also include mass destruction of cities and have long lasting effects on a country's economy. Armed conflict has important indirect negative consequences on infrastructure, public health provision, and social order. These indirect consequences are often overlooked and unappreciated.
