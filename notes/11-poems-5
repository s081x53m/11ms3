                Notes by: Subarna Poudel
                <br>
                <br>


                Summary<br>
                The first stanza opens with speaker offering roses and a wedding gown in her husband&rsquo;s grave. In
                the second stanza, he gives the speaker medals, silver stars, and a badge. These items seem to be less
                meaningful and personal than the items that the speaker offers.<br>
                <br>
                The pattern &lsquo;the speaker offers much more than her husband&rsquo; continues throughout the poem,
                except in the final stanza. In the third stanza, the speaker offers him her youth. The fourth stanza
                reveals that her husband gives her the smell of blood. For the speaker her husband&rsquo;s offerings are
                insignificant to her.<br>
                <br>
                In the fifth stanza, the speaker gives him clouds of summer. She sacrifices her cold winters and
                springs. In the sixth stanza, it is mentioned that her husband remains unmoved by these offerings. In
                return he gives the speaker lips with no smile, arms without tenderness and eyes with no sight as he is
                dead.<br>
                <br>
                In the final stanza, the speaker deeply apologizes to her husband about her complain regarding his
                offerings. The speaker promises to meet him in their next life. She will keep the shrapnel as a token,
                which will help them know and recognize each other in next life.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Understanding the text <br>
                Answer the following questions.<br>
                a. Who is the speaker addressing and why can that person not hear or understand what she is saying?<br>
                &#10140; She is addressing her husband. He cannot hear or understand what she is saying because he is
                dead.<br>
                <br>
                b. What can you infer about the speaker&rsquo;s feelings for the person addressed as
                &ldquo;you&rdquo;?<br>
                &#10140; I can infer that the speaker's feelings for the person addressed as 'you' are so deep. She
                thinks him as her life. She misses him a lot. She remembers him every moment in her life. She feels her
                life incomplete without him. Her deep feelings can easily be seen in the first stanza where she offers
                roses and her wedding gown for her lovable person's tomb.<br>
                <br>
                c. What is the speaker&rsquo;s attitude toward war?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker's attitude toward war is quite negative. She has experienced the terrible war
                between America and Vietnam. She has lost the most lovable person of her life due to war. Due to the
                lack of him, she has been experiencing pitiable lonely life. She has presented various negative aspects
                of the war in her poem.<br>
                <br>
                d. In what ways do you think this person&rsquo;s fate has affected the speaker?<br>
                &#10140; I think this person's fate has affected the speaker. The absent person who is mentioned here in
                this poem was a brave soldier who had got medals and a badge for his bravery in the war. In the war of
                America and Vietnam, he got killed in the bomb explosion. After his death, the speaker is experiencing
                his lack. She is quite sad in her lonely life. She keeps on remembering her lovable person all the time.
                The ill-fate of the person has made her helpless, loveless and miserable.<br>
                <br>
                e. What does the speaker promise at the end of the poem? Why do you think the speaker does this?<br>
                &#10140; At the end of the poem, the speaker promises to meet her lovable person in their next life. She
                wants to hold shrapnel as proof to show him the reason behind his death and their separation. According
                to her, it will help them to recognize each other. I think the speaker does this because her love for
                the absent person is so deep. She wants to love with him again and again.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference to the context <br>
                a. What is the theme of the poem?<br>
                &#10140; The theme of the poem is the inhumanity and cruelty of the war and its negative impacts over
                humans. War never brings happiness for others but only snatches the happiness of others. It only invites
                disparity and dark future for others. Humans get extremely affected by war. War only provides gifts as
                death, blood, pains, loss, sorrows, destruction, downfall etc.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you? Why?<br>
                &#10140; The imagery is a literary device to represent things through the use of images. The speaker has
                used various images here in this poem to put forward her feelings against war. Here, we find images as
                roses on grave, wedding gown as a cover, a tomb with green grass, medals, badge, youth days, wardress
                with blood, clouds, winters, lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eye without sight, the body
                without motion, shrapnel as a token etc. Here, the imagery from the sixth stanza made a great impression
                on me because here in the sixth stanza, the speaker relates to all those things which she has got from
                her missing lovable person. Due to the bad impacts of war, her lovable person has left her providing
                lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight and the body without motion. This
                stanza has shown the pitiable condition of the speaker's lonely life without her lovable person.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.<br>
                &#10140; Figurative language is phrasing that the goes beyond the literal meaning of words to get a
                message. We find the use of irony, apostrophe, anaphora, and metaphor as the figurative language here in
                this poem. The post has used imageries and metaphors much.<br>
                <br>
                The title of this poem itself is ironic which refers to the gifts of war as pains, sorrows, losses,
                blood etc. to humans.<br>
                <br>
                Next, the poet has also used the literary device of the apostrophe, which refers to a sudden exclamatory
                piece of dialogue addressed to someone or something, especially absent. Here in this poem, the speaker
                addresses an absent person and says him about the inhuman picture of war. Anaphora refers to the
                repetition of the same words at the beginning of a line. Here, the poet has used the same words at the
                beginning of the line as &quot;You give me&quot; in the second, fourth and sixth stanza. These words
                have been repeated thrice in the sixth stanza. Here, the poet has presented an irony relating with the
                gifts which the war, as well as her lovable person (a soldier), has provided her.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                d. What does the speaker &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in this poem? What does the person addressed as
                &ldquo;you&rdquo; give in return?<br>
                &#10140; The speaker offers various things in this poem to her lovable person. She offers roses, her
                wedding gown, her youth, clouds, cold winters etc. The person addressed as &quot;you&quot; gives her the
                medals with shining stars, badge with yellow pips, the smell of blood from wardress, lips without a
                smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight, body without motion etc.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an
                abstract idea in such a way as if it were present and can understand. Discuss the poem in relation to
                apostrophe.<br>
                &#10140; This poem &quot;The Gifts in Wartime&quot; is about the inhuman picture of war and its effects
                on humans. Here, the speaker has perfectly made use of apostrophe where she is seen addressing an absent
                person. Here, she is using her convincing lines for the person who is no more. She tries her best to
                make him realize about her deep lovable feelings for him. From the first stanza to the last, she keeps
                on making the absent person realize about her presents, sacrifices, lonely feelings, helplessness, and
                the gifts of war as medals, badge, and army dress with painful feelings, death, etc. She relates to him
                about her lonely life where she has experienced a lot of pains without him. She has even made him
                realize the main reason behind his death and their separation. This poem has presented the speaker and
                her dialogues for the absent person in such a way if the person is listening and understanding all her
                words. This poem has shown the bitter reality of war on humans through the speaker's dialogues for her
                absent lovable person using the apostrophe.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Reference beyond the text <br>
                a. One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. In your opinion, how might the speaker
                in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did? Explain.<br>
                &#10140; The speaker here in this poem has become successful to convey a serious message about the
                inhumanity of war to all her readers. War always invites a dark future for all. The victim in the
                battlefield isn&rsquo;t only the sufferer but also all those people who are closely connected with
                him/her. The speaker of this poem has also become the victim of the war along with her lovable person's
                death. Here, the saying of the speaker related with her acts and her sacrifices in her lonely life might
                have benefited her to forward her experience of war as a sufferer to all her readers. The readers have
                got ideas about the bad impacts of war and its long term effects on humans through her painful
                feelings.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                b. Write an essay on the effects of war.<br>
                &#10140; <br>
                Effects of War<br>
                War is a situation or a period of fighting between countries or groups of people. War generally involves
                the use of weapons, a military organization and soldiers. War is a situation in which a nation enforces
                its rights by using force. War is the bitter reality through which the downfall of humans is created. It
                is good for nothing. War and its effects on humans are seen in both aspects: physical and psychological.
                War creates long term effects on humans. War invites a dark future for all. War never provides happiness
                to others but snatches the happiness of others. The victims of war always remain in fear. It snatches
                thousands of lives. Death, injury, sexual violence, malnutrition, illness, and disability etc. are some
                of the most threatening physical consequences of war, while post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD),
                depression, and anxiety are some of the psychological effects.<br>
