    <center>All the World's a Stage</center><br><h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
Shakespeare seems to have the impression, in the poem, that human life is not real. What we see and hear
isn&rsquo;t a reality. Human life is a play of make-believe. Here Shakespeare traces human life through
the famous seven ages &ndash; the infant in arms, the schoolboy, the lover, the soldier, the justice,
the retired man, and the worn-out senior, sinking back into dissolution. The whole world&rsquo;s a
stage. We&lsquo;re only actors. We enter the stage and we go off it again. One man in his lifetime plays
a lot of roles. At first, he plays the part of the infant, crying and throwing milk in the arms of the
nurse.
<br><br>
Then he plays the part of a schoolboy who is not willing to go to school. With his shining face of the
morning, he trudges at the pace of the snail. Then there comes the lover. He sighs like a furnace, and
writes pitiful verses, addressing his mistress. He plays the role of a soldier. It&rsquo;s stocked with
all the violent oaths. He&rsquo;s wearing a wonderful beard. In a quarrel, he is too sensitive and fast
and hasty. He is willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of unsubstantial glory. Then he will play
the role of judge. He&rsquo;s a bulging belly man, with severe eyes. He&rsquo;s a very wise man.
<br><br>
Then Shakespeare describes his old age. It&rsquo;s pretty funny. The old man is in slippers, wearing
glasses. His mannish voice once more turns into a child&rsquo;s shrill tone. The last role is the second
child. It&rsquo;s so full of forgetfulness. It&rsquo;s without teeth, without eyes, without taste,
without everything.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Understanding the text</h3> 
<br>
<span>Answer the following questions.</span>
<br>
<span>a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The poet compares the world to a stage because he considers all men and women like the actors
of a drama. These actors perform their different roles here in this stage and leave this worldly stage
one day.
<br><br>
<span>b. What is the first stage in a human's life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The first stage in a human's life is the stage of infanthood. It can be a troubling stage in
the sense that this stage is a fully dependent stage where the infant is fully under the care of the
mother. The infant can cry and even vomit anytime in mother's arms.
<br><br>
<span>c. Describe the second stage of life based on the poem.</span>
<br>
&#10140; The second stage of life is the stage of boyhood. In this stage, the boy is a school going,
student. He slings his bag over his shoulder with his shining face and creeps to school unwillingly like
a snail.
<br><br>
<span>d. Why is the last stage called second childhood?</span>
<br>
&#10140; The last stage is called second childhood because here in this stage the man loses his senses
of sight, hearing, smell and taste. He acts like a child and finally exits from the roles of his
life.
<br><br>
<span>e. In what sense are we the players in the world stage?</span>
<br>
&#10140; We are the players in the world stage in the sense that we perform different roles here in this
world stage. We play seven different roles in our entire lifetime and finally depart from this world
stage.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Reference to the context</h3> 
<br>
<span>a. Explain the following lines:</span>
<br>
<i>
    All the world's a stage,
    <br>
    And all the men and women merely players
</i>
<br>
<br>
&#10140; Here in these lines, the poet has compared the whole world with a stage where men and women are
only players (actors). After birth, they perform their many roles here in this worldly stage and
finally, leave this stage moving towards their final destination (death).
<br><br><br>
<span>b. Explain the following lines briefly with Reference to the context.</span>
<br>
<i>
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    <br>
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
</i>
<br>
<br>
&#10140; These beautiful lines have been taken from William Shakespeare's realistic poem &quot;All the
World's a Stage&quot;. These lines are the parts of Jacues's monologue. Here, the poet has said that the
people in the world have their entrances (birth) and exits (death). People arrive here in this worldly
stage through birth and leave this stage through death. A man here in this worldly stage has to perform
many roles in his lifetime and leave the stage after his death.
<br><br><br>
<span>c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.</span>
<br>
<i>
    Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
    <br>
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    <br>
    Unwillingly to school.
</i>
<br><br>
<b>i. Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?</b>
<br>
&#10140; The childhood stage of life is being referred to here by the poet.
<br><br>
<b>ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?</b>
<br>
&#10140; In the second line, simile, a figure of speech has been employed where the boy has been
compared with snail using like.
<br><br>
<b>iii. Who is compared to the snail?</b>
<br>
&#10140; The school-going boy is compared to the snail.
<br><br>
<b>iv. Does the boy go to the school willingly?</b>
<br>
&#10140;No, the boy doesn't go to the school willingly. His unwillingness can easily be the motion of
snail towards his school.
<br><br><br>
<span>
    d. Simile and metaphor are the two major poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of
    each.
</span>
<br>
&#10140; Here in this poem, we find major poetic devices as simile and metaphor. The poet has used these
poetic devices a lot. The examples of simile and metaphor of this poem are as follows:
<br><br>
a) &quot;All the world's a stage&quot; - Metaphor
<br>
b) &quot;And all the men and women merely players&quot; - Metaphor
<br>
c) &quot;And shining morning face, creeping like a snail&quot; - Simile
<br>
d) &quot;Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,&quot; - Simile
<br>
e) &quot;Seeking the bubble reputation&quot; - Metaphor
<br>
f) &quot;His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide&quot; - Metaphor.
<br>
g) &quot;and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble&quot; - Metaphor.
<br><br><br>
<span>
    e. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage
    and all the people living in it are mere players?
</span>
<br>
&#10140; The poet uses a narrative style to express his innermost emotions about how he thinks that the
world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players or characters. These characters go
through seven different phases in their lives. He has explained the real aspects of human life for all
readers to understand the reality of life.
<br><br><br>
<span>f. What is the theme of this poem?</span>
<br>
&#10140; In &lsquo;All the world&rsquo;s a stage&rsquo; Shakespeare discusses the futility of
humanity&rsquo;s place in the world. He explores themes of time, aging, memory, and the purpose of life.
Through the monologue&rsquo;s central conceit, that everyone is simply a player in a larger game that
they have no control over, he brings the themes together. Shakespeare takes the reader through the
stages of life, starting with infancy and childhood and ending up with an old man who&rsquo;s been a
lover, a soldier, and a judge. The &ldquo;man&rdquo; dies after reverting back to a state that&rsquo;s
close to childhood and infancy.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Reference beyond the text</h3> 
<br><br>
<span>
    a. Describe the various stages of human life picturised in the poem &quot;All the world's a
    stage.&quot;
</span>
<br>
&#10140; According to Shakespeare, the world is a stage and everyone is a player. He says that every man
has seven stages during his lifetime. He performs different seven roles in his lifetime and finally
exits from this worldly stage. The first stage of a man is childhood. He plays in the arms of his
mother. He often vomits and cries in this stage. In his second stage, the man is an unwilling school
going, student. He becomes a lover in his third stage. He is very busy composing ballads for his beloved
and yearns for her attention. In the fourth stage, he is aggressive and ambitious. He seeks reputation
in all what he does. He is ready to guard his country and becomes a soldier. In his fifth stage, he
becomes a fair judge with maturity and wisdom. In the sixth stage, he is seen with loose pantaloons and
spectacles. His manly voice changes into a childish treble. The last stage of all is his second
childhood. Slowly, he loses his faculties of sight, hearing, smell and taste and exits from the roles of
his life. Thus, Shakespeare has presented the pictures of the seven stages of a man's life in the poem
'All the World's a Stage'. 
<br><br><br>
<span>b. Is Shakespeare's comparison of human's life with a drama stage apt? How?</span>
<br>
&#10140; Shakespeare has compared human life to a play or drama played by every man and woman. He has
described seven stages of life, which are like the seven acts of a play.
<br><br>
The comparison of the world to a stage and people to actors goes before Shakespeare. We find such
comparisons made in many philosophical books too. 
<br><br>
But, even if nobody had written about it, it is by a simple observation of life around us we find the
same thing happening. Everybody takes birth, grows, and with every growth, man's life changes. He works,
fulfils duties and responsibilities according to age, and finally leaves the world. 
<br><br>
This simple observation tells us Shakespeare's comparison of human life with a drama is very apt.
